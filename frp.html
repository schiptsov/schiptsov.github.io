There is what is wrong with it as a supposedly coherent set of concepts.
</p>

<p>
<i>They assume time as being something real (actual, existent, of its
own)</i>. And this leads to a mess - the modelers introduce a whole bunch
of <i>unnatural</i>, unnecessary, redundant abstractions, instead to just
having a few right ones.
</p>

<p>
The main problem is in trying to get a function from time to a value:
<code>Time -&gt; a</code>, which means assuming something that isn&rsquo;t there.
</p>

<p>
The main difficulty is that they are trying to superimpose a ruler to
whatever isn&rsquo;t there yet.
</p>

<p>
It takes time and very careful, precise wording to explain (without
usual narcissistic verbiage so prevailed within Haskell community).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3e7b5e1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3e7b5e1">What exactly is wrong.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e7b5e1">
<p>
When we view a function as a set of ordered pairs and the whole
<i>functional space</i> as a result of a <i>Cartesian Product of Domain and
Codomain</i> we have a fundamental problem - the function is <i>not total</i>,
it is not an <i>one-to-one</i> relation, so it is not a function at all.
</p>

<p>
One cannot use a ruler before one gets an &ldquo;object&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The function of <code>a -&gt; (Time, a)</code> is just a log. it tags an event with a
<i>time-tag</i>. This also means that the event <code>a</code> is already <i>observed</i> (by
those who tags it with a <i>timestamp</i> - who used the ruler) - it is
already <i>emerged from a source</i>.
</p>

<p>
Again, <code>Time -&gt; a</code> is just wrong.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org64fc5e4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org64fc5e4">Partial function</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org64fc5e4">
<p>
If <i>partial function</i> from an <i>abstract</i> <code>Time</code> is what they want, that
would mean getting <code>Nothing</code> most of the time, which is what a
<i>busy-waiting</i> is.
</p>

<p>
Nature does not use a <i>busy-waiting</i> because it is <i>enery-inefficient</i>,
grossly inefficient. It uses <i>tresholds</i> and <i>triggers</i> (which is what a
nervous system is - a <i>signal-propagation</i> network).
</p>

<p>
<code>Maybe</code> monad comes to the mind, which propagates <code>Nothing</code> and
distributes <code>f</code> over its <code>Just x</code>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org33a82f0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org33a82f0">Number Line</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org33a82f0">
<p>
A Number Line is an <i>imaginary mental construction</i> (a generalized abstraction of the mind of an external observer) which is used to <i>visualize</i> (and imagine) the generalized abstract concept of a <i>Number</i>.
</p>

<p>
Originally it was just a primitive ruler - a stick with equally-spaced notches or marks, which is, it turns out, a common but decissive pattern of the mind. An external observer is required to use a ruler, and without such an observer the whole notion <i>does not exits</i> anywhere outside his head.
</p>

<p>
This is how we (intelligent observers) measure lengths, including lengths of time, which itself is an <i>non-existent, abstract notion derived by an external observer</i>. You will be unable to find any time anywhere outside your head.
</p>

<p>
Again, that is it - just equally-spaced marks superimposed onto observed phenomena by an external (relative to the phenomena) observer.
</p>

<p>
This concrete (or abstract) ruler is superimposed against (onto) something, and the number of notches are counted (summed up or added together).
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org7a6f091">Math</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a6f091">
<p>
In abstract mathematics the notion of counting is exactly this - superimpose an imaginary Number Line and associate each &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; with a Number.
</p>

<p>
We can think of it as a Set of ordered pairs (and a Cartesian Product) and, yes, <code>length</code> is the same process as <code>count</code> (how many)
</p>
<pre class="example">
count xs = fst . last $ zip [1 ..] xs
  where
    zip (n : ns) (x : xs) = (n, x) : zip ns xs
    zip _ _               = []
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-org9e420cf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9e420cf">Time</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9e420cf">
<p>
Time is modeled as discrete (ticks) or continuous (a Real line).
</p>

<p>
Continuous time is mathematically more convenient and derivatives and differential calculus arise from this notion.
</p>

<p>
No matter how one model it - as discrete or continuous - it does not make it more <i>real</i>.
</p>

<p>
The assumed implication that continuois time can vary is just a play of conditioned (by shared culture) mind - pure imagination, however sophisticated.
</p>

<h2 id="org33388ff">Change in Time</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org33388ff">
<p>
Once you have superimposed time you have a change over time, or
\[\frac{dy}{dt}\]

<div id="outline-container-orgaa4cf40" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgaa4cf40">FRP</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaa4cf40">
<p>
We associate a continuous <i>time-line</i> with a discrete event &ldquo;flow&rdquo; (stream).
</p>

<p>
So we get a &ldquo;log&rdquo; (ledger) - such event occurred at such timestamp.
</p>

<p>
And that is it.
</p>

<p>
The better name for &ldquo;Behavior&rdquo; is &ldquo;Signal&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Semantically it is a <i>relation</i> over continuous (Real) time.
</p>

<p>
The relation is <i>many-to-one</i> which means that many timestamps result in the same <code>a</code>.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, a time-line, just as a number-line, have associative &ldquo;addition&rdquo; or &ldquo;concatenation&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Associativity of concatenation and distribution of operations (maps) over concatenation are <i>Universal patterns</i> on <i>linear sequences</i>.
</p>

<p>
RNA and DNA are such sequences and enzymes &ldquo;distribute&rdquo; over them.
</p>

<p>
The universal <i>Algebraic notions (structures)</i> are, yes, generalized abstractions of&#x2026; guess whom?
</p>

<p>
So, all the familiar /abstract algebraic structures (with corresponding &ldquo;laws&rdquo;) are there.
