<h1 class="title">Logic</h1>
</header><p>
Systems of <i>mathematical</i> logic (and of Classic logic) are too abstract
and too general for actual reality. These systems are <i>self-contained</i>,
sound and <i>complete</i>, but only within the context of underlying
axiomatic system (a set of assumptions taken for granted).
</p>

<p>
Actual reality outside of a window, however, is governed by the <i>Causality
Principle</i>, and in it neither <i>contradictions</i>, nor <i>falsehoods</i> exists.
</p>

<p>
Falsehoods are <i>products of the mind</i>, so are contradictions, and, of
course, in (the context of) actual reality <code>False</code> <i>implies</i> nothing.
</p>

<p>
The notion of <i>implication</i> itself, which captured in a human language as
<i>if this then that</i> or <i>therefore</i>, captures (in turn) the working of
the Causality Principle (or the Law Of Causality) which is, perhaps, the
only <i>law</i> out there.
</p>

<p>
Also, a truth table for mathematical <i>inclusive or</i> says that <code>both T is T</code> but this is called <code>AND</code>, not <code>OR</code>. Or means <i>either</i>, not both. Both is called <code>AND</code>.
However, there is a perfect explanation for <i>&ldquo;or both&rdquo;</i> from the set-theoretic point of view - it is just an some area on a Vienn diagram, so this logic depends on a context (as it should be) and is <i>not universally applicable</i> (which very few people understood).
Application of mathematical logic outside of a mathematical (set theoretical) context is an error.
</p>

<p>
So, the system of <i>Classical Logic</i>, which nowadays expressed using
<i>Boolean algebra</i>, is applicable only to mathematical contexts and to
symbolic expressions.
</p>

<p>
The system made to be nice, symmetric and <i>complete</i> artificially, by
human minds, to fulfill some <i>aesthetic</i> goals. To collapse it back down
to <code>What Is</code>, we have to sacrifice symmetry. The truth tables has to be
purged from anything that uses <code>False</code> as a valid premise (again,
falsehoods do not exist, so they cannot be a <i>required precondition</i>).
</p>

<p>
Notice, that all the major <i>tautologies</i> will be still valid, except one
\[A \Rightarrow (A \land B) \]
which misses the fact that \(B\) is <i>not necessary</i> and <i>unrelated</i>.
</p>

<p>
The only &ldquo;true&rdquo; tautology is, of course, <i>Modus Ponens</i> which captures
the <i>Causality Principle</i> itself, and written this way
\[((A \Rightarrow B) \land A) \Rightarrow B\]
Is an <i>application of a function</i> - the core of The <i>Lambda Calculus</i>,
and rewritten the other way
\[(A \land (A \Rightarrow B)) \Rightarrow B\]
is a functional <i>pipeline</i> - the core notion for a <i>funtion
composition</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is how to ground everything back to <code>What Is</code>, out of which it
arose.
</p>

<p>
Those who are trying to apply <i>proof assistants</i> to models which
captures some aspects of reality should consider purging their truth
tables (and introduce <i>runtime errors</i> when <code>False</code> is a premise).
</p>

<p>
<code>What Is</code> (not what we think might be) is the best type-checker.
