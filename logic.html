    </header>
    <p>Systems of <i>mathematical</i> logic (and of Classic logic)
    are too abstract and too general to for actual reality. These
    systems are <i>self-contained</i>, sound and <i>complete</i>,
    but only withing the context of underlying axiomatic system (a
    set of assumptions taken for granted).</p>
    <p>Actual reality outside a window, however, is governed by the
    Causality Principle, and in it neither <i>contradictions</i>,
    nor <i>falsehoods</i> exists.</p>
    <p>Falsehoods are products of the mind, so are contradictions,
    and, of course, in (the context of) actual reality
    <code>False</code> <i>implies</i> nothing.</p>
    <p>The notion of implication itself, which captured in a human
    language as <i>if this then that</i> or <i>therefore</i>,
    captures (in turn) the working of the Causality principle (or
    the Law Of Causality) which is, perhaps, the only law out
    there.</p>
    <p>So, the system of Classical Logic, which nowadays expressed
    using Boolean values, is applicable only to mathematical
    contexts and of symbolic expressions.</p>
    <p>The system made to be nice, symmetric and <i>complete</i>
    artificially, by human minds, to fulfill some <i>aesthetic</i>
    goals. To collapse it back down to <code>What Is</code>, we
    have to sacrifice symmetry. The truth tables has to be purged
    from anything that uses <code>False</code> as a valid premise
    (again, falsehoods do not exist, so they cannot be a required
    precondition).</p>
    <p>Notice, that all the major <i>tautologies</i> will be still
    valid, except one \[A \Rightarrow (A \land B) \] Which misses
    the fact that \(B\) is <i>not necessary</i> and
    <i>unrelated</i>.</p>
    <p>The only “true” tautology is, of course, <i>Modus Ponens</i>
    which captures the <i>Causality Principle</i> itself, and
    written this way \[((A \Rightarrow B) \land A) \Rightarrow B\]
    Is and <i>application of a function</i> - the core of The
    <i>Lambda Calculus</i>, and rewritten the other way \[(A \land
    (A \Rightarrow B)) \Rightarrow B\] is a functional
    <i>pipeline</i> - the core notion for a <i>funtion
    composition</i>.</p>
    <p>This is how to ground everything back to <code>What
    Is</code>, out of which it arose.</p>
    <p>Those who are trying to apply <i>proof assistants</i> to
    models which captures some aspects of reality should consider
    purging their truth tables (and introduce <i>runtime errors</i>
    when <code>False</code> is a premise).</p>
    <p><code>What Is</code> (not what we think might be) is the
    best type-checker.</p>
