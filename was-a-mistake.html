<h2 id="orgc43585b">Algol was a mistake</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc43585b">
<p>
Algol has been designed as a <i>theoretical imperative language</i>, on assumption that
a program will run on a &ldquo;whole computer&rdquo;, as it used to be back then before any
<i>time-sharing</i> systems from IBM or AT&amp;T.
</p>

<p>
The main mistake was to make it <i>imperative</i>. The resulting <i>lineage</i>, which
includes C, C++, Java and even Javascript is nothing but pain and suffering (and you can tell!).

<h2 id="org1742ee9">OOP was a mistake</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1742ee9">
<p>
OOP without <i>message-passing</i> (and sharing nothing) at is core was a mistake. The
<i>theoretical claim</i> or promise of total encapsulation never materialized.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, <i>stateful</i> objects do not <i>compose</i> and multi-threading <i>breaks the
state encapsulation</i>. It routinely gets corrupted on a multi-threaded and multi-core settings.

<h2 id="org474b54d">Pthreads was a mistake</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org474b54d">
<p>
Threads break process isolation, which is the fundamental and <i>required</i>
characteristic of a process, plain and simple. It resulted in an <i>unsound</i>
abstraction with all the well-known consequences.
</p>

<p>
In short, an imperative multi-threaded OOP is a <i>low-effort toxic junkfood</i> of our
trade.
</p>

<p>
There are, however, things even worse than JVM. What happens inside a
Javascript runtime should really not being discussed by sane, cultured, intelligent people.

<h2 id="org45a7fce">Erlang</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org45a7fce">
<p>
The designers of the Erlang language spent a lot of effort to use only sound
abstractions and to place <i>asynchronous message-passing</i> at the center (as the
foundational feature), restricting any other form of <i>sharing</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is important to realize that, unlike Java (which is a plain <i>imperative OOP
in C++</i>), the Erlang <i>runtime</i> has also been designed with <i>sharing nothing</i>
principle in mind, and both <i>message-passing</i> and <i>process isolation</i> has been done
right (unlike threads, they do not share even the <i>stack</i>).
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;outside world&rdquo; is accessible only thought <i>ports</i> and corresponding
standardized <i>drivers</i>.
</p>

<p>
Last, but not least, is the principle-guided <i>uniformity</i>. In Erlang everything
looks like an isolated process, capable of receiving and sending messages in a
uniform way. This is an example of a <i>conceptual integrity</i> at work.
</p>

<p>
The results are so remarkable, that OO people prefer do not talk and ignore
Erlang or the industrial (telecom and manufacturing) projects based on it.
