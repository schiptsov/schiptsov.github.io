<h1 class="title">The Paths of Karma</h1>
</header><p>
The question &ldquo;how to program&rdquo; is an easy one. The difficult question is <i>&ldquo;what to program and why&rdquo;</i>.
</p>

<p>
Finally I am able to put these universal <i>notions</i> into less wrong words.
</p>

<p>
What we call &ldquo;the causality principle&rdquo; (or &ldquo;karma&rdquo;) can be generalized
as an <i>acyclic graph with no &ldquo;forks&rdquo;</i> (in principle), only &ldquo;joins&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Causality has a <i>direction</i>, which cannot be reversed.
So it is a <i>directed graph</i>.
</p>

<p>
What appears to be a <i>loop</i> is actually a <i>spiral</i>,
so each &ldquo;round&rdquo; is a <i>new segment of a path</i>.
</p>

<p>
A <i>path</i> is always a <i>sequence</i> of steps (no forks, joins or loops),
but multiple causes determine which branch to be taken
at an abstract &ldquo;fork&rdquo; of potential choices.
</p>

<p>
Thus &ldquo;forks&rdquo; are only apparent, while resulting <i>sequences</i> (of steps) are real.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Joins&rdquo; represent multiple factors that come together.
</p>

<p>
Both forks and joins are &ldquo;higher level&rdquo; abstractions, similar to <i>types</i>.
They add <i>more abstract structure</i> to our understanding of What Is.
</p>

<p>
So any <i>path</i> (a sequence of steps) could be augmented with two directed, acyclic graphs
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>one with forks (choices)</li>
<li>one with joins (factors)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The crucial point is that these are distinct.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;AI&rdquo; game devs do something very similar but less structured.
</p>

<p>
Abstract forks and joins are useful modeling tools.
</p>

<p>
Associating a cost or any other <i>weight</i> (including a probability)
to each branch of a tree (a fork) is a general framework.
</p>

<p>
Assigning wights to every &ldquo;factor&rdquo; of a join is another one.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that due to partial observability and inherited complexity of <i>What Is</i> (never perfect information except in abstract settings) we cannot know (in principle) that every actual (leave alone possible) &ldquo;factor&rdquo; is listed with an adequate &ldquo;weight&rdquo; or all the potential choices are known, and incorrect ones has been eliminated (pruned out).
</p>

<p>
As usual, all models are wrong (flawed maps) but some are useful.
