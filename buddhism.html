    <p>To collapse everithing back to <i>What Is</i> is an ultimate
    Buddhist practice.</p>
    <p>Sitting in <i>zazen</i> is an <i>ultimate practice</i> which
    teaches the way of <i>observing of</i> and <i>dealing with</i>
    [“waves in”] ones own mind.</p>
    <p>One has to actually experience (realize) that the mind could
    be in more than one state, and, ultimately, that there are
    <i>two minds</i>, - one so-called premordial awareness, or the
    “animal mind” (without any negative connotations - never
    confused, closest to reality) and socially conditioned,
    language-based intellect infested with abstract concepts
    bullshit, which are sort of viruses (we call them “memes”
    nowadays).</p>
    <p>There is overwhelming evidential support from modern
    neuroscience that the “ancient”, animal parts of the brain are
    still function <i>in parallel</i> with “modern” cortexes and
    the actual, non-metaphorical conflicts arise all the time.</p>
    <p>The current notions of “emptional intelligence”, “flow”, and
    so on are just another views of the same “mountain” and has
    been explored in ancient Buddhist literature millennia ago.</p>
    <p>Another actual realization which we owe to ancient Buddhist
    practitioners is that <i>there is no continuity of the
    mind</i>, and it arises on demand for a sensory event, only to
    fade off and to be replaced by arousal of a “new version” of it
    upon another event.</p>
    <p>A “new version” is due to the neorological fact that each
    neuron changes its state afger bein activated or “fired”.</p>
    <p>The best metaphor is an image on the screen of your phone
    which is apparently (to an observer) continuous, while in fact
    it arises and fades into complete darkness 60 times per second
    (just like that electical bulb above your head).</p>
    <p>These observations lead to the ultimate principle of
    <i>impermanence</i> and <i>an illusory nature</i> of what we
    call <i>Our Mind</i> or <i>Our Self</i>, and a proper
    realization of this <i>ultimately right understanding</i> is
    the end of the journey - modern’s day <i>vedanta</i>.</p>
    <p>It is important to realize that all the findings of early
    Buddhists and Vedantists are due to <i>introspection</i> - the
    only tool available at the time.</p>
    <p>As with the methaphor of observing the same mountain from
    different points of view, all the introspective efforts would
    ultimately end to the same “mountain” or “reality” and this is
    why various sects attained one or more fundamental realization
    which does not contradict (and actually complement) each
    other.</p>
    <p>What Dzongchen calls “Primodrial Awareness” and places it
    before intellect is that “animal mind” or processes in the
    older (prior to cortexes and language areas) brain structures.
    This is what Zen sects call “Big Mind” as opposed to “Small
    Mind” of a conditioned, language-based intellect.</p>
    <p>The point of this essay is to summarize my hacks of Buddhism
    and reduce <i>mountains of written bullshit</i> back to What
    Is.</p>
    <p>When one calms down or “stops” ones language-based intellect
    what one “sees” or <i>become aware of</i> is that ancient
    “animal mind”, and the <i>awareness itself</i>. It is that
    fundamental.</p>
    <p>When one enters the state of “flow”, which is utilizing
    one’s animal mind <i>“as intended” by evolution</i> one
    experiences “optimal performance” exactly because the
    brain-body complex works as it supposed to.</p>
    <p>Archery is the oldest known practice of having the state of
    “flow”, and an ultimate learning environment, among other
    things. Don’t credit modern pop-sci writers with too much. In
    the aspect of self-awareness and self-control archery is
    equivalent to Zen sitting. Again, the mountain is one and the
    same.</p>
    <p>Yes, there is no permanent Mind, leave alone Self. Yes, it
    is <i>event-driven and reactive</i> (with a lot of
    <i>priming</i> and <i>caching</i> mechanisms explored by late
    20th century psychology).</p>
    <p>And, Yes, one constucts actual <i>maps, whuich are not the
    territory</i> of reality with actual strucutes on top of
    pre-arranged (by evolution) neural networks, which update its
    “weights” with every firing caused by some experience.</p>
    <p>From the realization of <i>not having any permanent Self</i>
    everything follows - there is literally nothing to lose and
    worry about because having something is an illusion. The only
    thing one can do is to see things as they are and to accept
    everything as it is.</p>
