Let&rsquo;s ask some questions that no one usually asks.
</p>

<p>
<i>Why</i> math is the way it is?
</p>

<p>
Well, there are a couple of universally fundamental notions behind all of
mathematics - the notion of an <i>external observer</i> (its <i>inner representation</i> of
the environment based on aggregating <i>sensory input</i>) and the notion of a
<i>separate pile</i> as an <i>observed</i> basis of any <i>generalized</i> abstract category.
</p>

<p>
Another universal and fundamental notion is that <i>things</i> (such as <i>atoms</i> or
<i>molecules</i>) and <i>processes</i> have their own unique <i>shapes</i>, compounds and components,
which give rise to <i>emergent properties</i> of complex entities (basically,
<i>everything is a process</i>).
</p>

<p>
<i>Generalizations</i> (by the mind of an external observer) and <i>abstractions</i> (which
put together entities based on similarity by having particular properties in
common, ignoring other differences)  form the basis of all mathematics.
</p>

<p>
For each entity (process) there is a universal notion of <i>locality</i> and related
(and relative) notion of a <i>distance</i> with respect to it. Locality is the central
notion of physics, while distance is central to geometry.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, a further step has been taken to study abstract systems
which can be built from a finite set of <i>axioms</i> (which are premises) - statements
taken for granted (the same as statements of fact - of What Is).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org51744df" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org51744df">The mind</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org51744df">
<p>
So, what the mind of an external observer does? It &ldquo;parses&rdquo; the input,
<i>distinguishes</i>, <i>categorizes</i> (groups up) and <i>labels</i>. The other word for this is
<i>&ldquo;selects&rdquo;</i>. The mind observes, categorizes, labels (with language &ldquo;tags&rdquo;) and
<i>selects</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is <i>the true basis</i> for what we call Logic and Mathematics and. Logic is not
a discipline of rigorous argument, prior to that, it is the discipline of the
mind of an external observer.
</p>

<p>
Notice that <i>neither the observed world or an observing mind</i> are arbitrary or
unrelated. The mind has been evolved in the very same environment it has been
observing and therefore &ldquo;incorporate&rdquo; (is subject to) the fundamenal contreaints
of this particular environment (such as gravity, temperature, presence of soild
and water, day/night changes, etc).
</p>

<p>
Why to mention all this? Because this is why, in particular, the <i>Set
comprehension</i> notation or notations of some <i>logical formalisms</i> are the way they
are.
</p>

<h2 id="org353054f">Set comprehensions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org353054f">
<p>
The generalized and abstracted out notions of the mind of an external observer are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>such that</i> (selection)</li>
<li><i>and also</i> (a fucking mess)</li>
<li><i>or</i> (a partition)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga82fe21" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga82fe21">AND ALSO</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga82fe21">
<p>
The notion of <i>and also</i> is the most overloaded one, and has at least <i>three fundamentally
distinct meanings</i>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>more than one</i> (the notion generalized from a <i>pile</i>, usually denoted as <code>,</code>)</li>
<li><i>this and that</i> (in the context of attributes or properties, denoted as <code>&amp;&amp;</code>)</li>
<li><i>simultaneously</i> (presented at the same locality, which is <i>prior to and implies</i> at the same time)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once this mess is sorted out adequately (within a <i>proper context</i>), everything becomes
straightforward and simple.

<h3 id="orgc355fd3">OR ELSE</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc355fd3">
<p>
The notion of <i>or else</i> is just a generalization of a distinct <i>partition</i> or
selection from a pile.

<p>
This ability to correctly trace everything back to the <i>&ldquo;What Is&rdquo;</i> is what makes
one a good philosopher and a good programmer, which, by the way, implies a good
mathematician.
</p>

<p>
Unlike mathematicians, we as good programmers, are concerned with
<i>representations</i> and <i>implementations</i> of our abstractions, not just classifying,
naming and studying emergent properties.
</p>

<p>
This is why we  have understand and focus on the <i>structure</i> of values, just like
everything in the Universe has its structure (out of which <i>processes</i> emerge).
</p>

<p>
Tracing everything back to reality allows us to discover and select among the
fundamental and optimal structures (a sequence, a tree, a table, a graph),
which, in turn, leads optimal code due to the <i>data dominates</i> principle.
</p>

<p>
The shape of recursive functions tend to mimic the shape of corresponding
recursive structures. Nothing is arbitrary or random.

<h2 id="org9a47c3c">Nothing is arbitrary or random</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9a47c3c">
<p>
It is not a random coincidence that well-researched, principle-guided functional
languages (and a few other fundamental notations, such as <i>Set Comprehensions</i>,
<i>Lambda Calculus, /BNF</i> etc.) are seem to <i>converge</i> to pure high-order functions
(the <i>referential transparency</i> property and the property of a <i>lexical closure</i>)
and <i>structural pattern-matching</i>. This is, obviously, a universal language
derived by billions of external observers, which mimics (matches) <i>&ldquo;What Is&rdquo;</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing arbitrary in <code>Erlang</code> or <code>ML</code> or even  <code>Haskell</code>. Just think about
it. There are the <i>whys</i> to justify why, lets say <code>Erlang</code> is the way it is, and
why Math and Logic are the way they are.
