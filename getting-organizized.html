Also known as a <i>productivity porn</i>.
</p>

<p>
The real reasons are that we have <i>very</i> limited mental capabilities, <i>very</i>
limited self-control and self-discipline, and very little time before inevitable cognitive
decline, and we usually are completely exhausted at the end of the day
with literally nothing accomplished .
</p>

<p>
So, this becomes a straightforward set of <i>basic optimizations</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>optimize for a good <i>8-hour</i> sleep every night</li>
<li>divide the day into &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, sun-followed parts</li>
<li>do not waste mornings, schedule them</li>
<li>stick to the daily routine, time-slots</li>
<li>write everything down</li>
<li>do physical exercise and food hacks</li>
<li>leave podcasts and light reading for the night</li>
<li>simple <code>org-mode</code> TODOs are enough for everything</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a side-note, <i>burn-outs</i> aren&rsquo;t just a meme, they ruin health and motivation very
quickly. Optimize to avoid them.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>avoid all-nighters and other extremes, tension and stress of any kind</li>
<li>spending long hours by just pushing harder is stupid and harmful</li>
<li>invest heavily in the tools of the trade</li>
<li>invest in your living and working environment</li>
<li><i>exercise regularly</i>, have time for yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is no way to make progress if one has been burned out. Just like it is with
top athletes &#x2013; an optimal scheduling, health measurements, and adaptive
sets of regular exercises are required. Just pushing hard will only ruin you.
</p>

<p>
When one begins to thing about &ldquo;how to be productive&rdquo; and start to look
at planning software - it is too late and one is <i>already fucked</i>.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the main, universal vehicle of any planning is still a plain old <i>sorted list</i> &#x2013; sorted by priorities or dates or any other <i>weights</i>.
</p>

<p>
With <code>org-mode</code> <i>tags</i> we could live in a <i>type-tagged universe</i> of values.
Lisps, by the way. are such <i>partitioned, type-tagged universes</i> of values.
</p>

<p>
<i>Tags</i> act as <i>types</i> by forming a <i>distinct set of tagged items (a
partition)</i> which means that things are <i>related</i> to the particular tag and
therefore to each other.
</p>

<p>
Multiple sorted lists are good-enough for everything, and there is <code>org-mode</code> for that.
</p>

<p>
<code>org-mode</code> provides <i>structuring</i> and <i>nesting</i> (which people call
&ldquo;outlining&rdquo;) - the fundamental, universal notions . It also provides
basic <i>categorization</i> mechanisms and semantic <i>tags</i>.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you have to develop a habit of using simple sorted <i>nested lists</i> and
minimal tools, which are parts of the <code>org-mode</code> package. The goal is to
build a nested hierarchical strures of texts which corresponds to
conceptual hierarchies of our mind and systems.
</p>

<p>
<i>Different kinds</i> of <code>org-mode</code> <i>keywords</i> loosely correspond to <i>type-classes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that <code>org-mode</code> <i>keywords</i> with <code>"|"</code> are essentially <i>union types</i>, and
also a <i>sequence of intermediate states</i>. They are <i>sum-types</i>.
</p>

<p>
They are the most powerful when defined in the &ldquo;header&rdquo; on a <i>per-file</i> basis. Thus
is a <i>basic typing or a type discipline</i> for entries.
</p>

<p>
The most difficult thing is to distill the essential workflow from an infinite number of possibilities to mess everything up with useless, redundant micro-management and an illusion of being &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
So, we write lists - PLANs and TODOs.
</p>

<p>
PLANs are more general and more about regular activities.
A PLAN may include <i>recurring</i> activities.
You may state &ldquo;running every other day&rdquo; in a PLAN.
Or you may say &ldquo;finish the Okasaki book&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
TODOs are about particular sequences of tasks to be done.
You may write &ldquo;implement this or that&rdquo; in a TODO.
</p>
