Also known as a <i>productivity porn</i>.
</p>

<p>
The real reasons are that we have <i>very</i> limited mental capabilities, <i>very</i>
limited self-control and self-discipline, and very little time before inevitable cognitive
decline, and we usually are completely exhausted at the end of the day
with literally nothing accomplished .
</p>

<p>
So, this becomes a straightforward set of <i>basic optimizations</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>optimize for a good <i>8-hour</i> sleep every night</li>
<li>divide the day into &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, sun-followed parts</li>
<li>do not waste mornings, schedule them</li>
<li>stick to the daily routine, time-slots</li>
<li>write everything down</li>
<li>do physical exercise and food hacks</li>
<li>leave podcasts and light reading for the night</li>
<li>simple <code>org-mode</code> TODOs are enough for everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When one begins to thing about &ldquo;how to be productive&rdquo; and start to look
at planning software - it is too late and one is already got fucked.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the main universal vehicle of any planning is a plain old <i>sorted list</i> &#x2013; sorted by priorities or dates or any other <i>weights</i>.
</p>

<p>
We could live in a type-tagged universe of values. <i>Tags</i> act as <i>types</i> by
forming a <i>set of tagged items</i> which means that they are <i>related</i> to the
tag and therefore to each other.
</p>

<p>
<i>Different kinds</i> of items loosely correspond to <i>type-classes</i>, or <i>kinds</i>
of types.
</p>

<p>
Multiple sorted lists are good-enough for everything, and there is <code>org-mode</code> for that.
</p>

<p>
<code>org-mode</code> provides <i>structuring</i> and <i>nesting</i> (which people call
&ldquo;outlining&rdquo;) - the fundamental, universal notions . It also provides
basic <i>categorization</i> mechanisms and semantic <i>tags</i>.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you have to develop a habit of using simple sorted <i>nested lists</i> and
minimal tools, which are parts of the <code>org-mode</code> package. The goal is to
build a nested hierarchical strures of texts which corresponds to
conceptual hierarchies of our mind and systems.
</p>

<p>
Notice that org <i>keywords</i> with <code>"|"</code> are essentially <i>union types</i>, and also a <i>sequence of intermediate states</i>.
</p>

<p>
They are the most powerful when defined in the &ldquo;header&rdquo; on a <i>per-file</i> basis. Thus
is a <i>basic typing or a type discipline</i> for entries.
</p>

<p>
The most difficult thing is to distill the essential workflow from an infinite number of possibilities to mess everything up with useless, redundant micro-management and an illusion of being &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
So, we write lists - PLANs and TODOs.
</p>

<p>
PLANs are more general and more about regular activities.
A PLAN may include <i>recurring</i> activities.
You may state &ldquo;running every other day&rdquo; in a PLAN.
Or you may say &ldquo;finish the Okasaki book&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
TODOs are about particular sequences of tasks to be done.
You may write &ldquo;implement this or that&rdquo; in a TODO.
</p>
