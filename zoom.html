    <p>To be any good as a programmer (not a <i>coder</i> or a
    webshitter - a person who does <i>webshit</i>) one has to be
    able to <i>zoom</i> through layers upon layers of abstractions
    (grounded in <i>What Is</i>) and being able to comprehend and
    understand <i>all the details</i> (or at least the fundamental
    <i>underlying principles</i>) at each level.</p>
    <p><i>Attention to details</i> is not optional at
    representation and implementation levels, and this is what
    largely constitutes Japanesse (or any other)
    <i>art-forms</i>.</p>
    <p>Principles, by the way, are correct (closest to <i>What
    Is</i>) but <i>informal</i> descriptions of what causes an
    <i>observable</i> (by an external observer) behavior (or a
    particualar <i>pattern</i>) at each level.</p>
    <p>Precise, formal describtions of proven <i>properties</i> of
    a particular abstraction (such as Natural Numbers) could also
    be called principles.</p>
    <p>Understanding of principles frees one from memorizing all
    the particular details.</p>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb463e67">
        <p>It is not an arbitrary coincedence that we see connected
        <a href="arrows.html">arrows</a> almost everywhere as we
        are trying to <a href="model.html">model</a> (using
        mathematics as a language of precision) aspects of the
        reality.</p>
        <p>Mathematics, by the way, is a formal <i>study of
        patterns</i> which arise in <i>What Is</i>. It expands by
        generalizing and defining <i>pure abstractions</i>
        (abstract entities) and studying their <i>properties</i>
        and <i>relations</i> among them.</p>
        <p>Mathematics, thus, is the most general language for
        talking about <i>common patterns</i> and well-defined (in
        terms of their <i>properties</i> and <i>structure</i> only)
        <i>abstractions</i>.</p>
        <p>When we see <i>connected arrows</i> we usually mean a
        <i>sequence of discrete steps</i>.</p>
        <p>A single <i>arrows</i> denotes a transition (or a
        transformation) - a single <i>step</i>, which may, in turn,
        be abstracted out as an <i>application</i> of a function or
        a binary operator.</p>
        <p>At a higher level (of types) an arrow also denotes a
        <i>composition</i> of funtions - a single step <i>at the
        level of pure functions</i> - one level higher than that of
        <i>values</i>.</p>
        <p>Notice that these are just arrows at <i>the type
        level</i></p>

          <p>There are actually two <i>ANDs</i>, which are always
          confused and sometimes not even distinguished</p>
          <ul class="org-ul">

          </ul>
          <p>This is the result that took long time for me to
          arrive at.</p>
          <p>Notice that the first <i>AND</i> is
          <i>declarative</i>, and is a generalization of <i>AND IS
          ALSO TRUE</i>, and (wow!) <i>2 AND ALSO 2</i> while the

        <h3 id="orgcfa95aa">The Category Theory</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcfa95aa">
          <p>Other people study functions and their
          <i>compositions</i> in terms of <i>dots and
          arrows</i>.</p>
          <p>The only usefulness of the Category Theory is that it
          formalizes what <i>common patterns</i> - common
          arrangements of arrows - are there and what properties
          such arrangements have. In particular, it is imortant to
          realize when considering a pattern that such and such
          arrows are <i>all that is there</i> (the only possible
          ones).</p>
          <p>When we constrain ourself to the patterns of arrows
          which does not have “forks”, but “joins” are possible
          (which corresponds to <i>collapcing</i> of a structure or
          to application a “multi-argument” or <i>curried</i>
          functions), we would arrive at a <i>most general
          structure</i> of almost everything <i>What Is</i>, as a
          generalized abstract <i>visual model</i>, of course.</p>
          <p>This is the obvious connection between TLA+ and the
          Category Theory, and this connection is, of course,
          through <i>What Is</i>.</p>
          <p>A <i>sequence of discrete steps</i>, which may be
          <i>denoted</i> as a set of connected arrows in a
          <i>linear</i> structure (or in a structure which can be
          traversed into a linear <i>path</i>, such as a
          <i>finite</i> tree) is a <i>universal</i>
          abstraction.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, <i>currying</i>, function
          <i>composition</i>, and <i>a transition from the current
          state to the next</i> form such sequences of steps or
          <i>pathes</i>, which always imply a <i>direction</i>,
          which, in turn, captures causality and <i>unfolding of a
          process</i> (by causality) in abstract “time”.</p>
          <p>Notice, that the only use for abstract theories such
          as the Set Theory or The Category Theory is that some
          <i>universal patterns</i> are precisely defined and thus
          <i>well understood</i>.</p>
          <p>When we reduce some part of a problem to something
          which is <i>well-understood</i> we can use all the
          related formal knowledge - theorems, lemmas, “laws”.</p>

        <h3 id="org2b18cfd">Functional Programming</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2b18cfd">
          <p>This, by the way, is the reason behind (and a
          connection to) the <i>functional programming
          paradigm</i>. There are well-understood pattens, and even
          “laws” in pure functional code which defines and
          implements <i>sequential</i>, <i>tree-like</i> and
          <i>table-like</i> data structures and related Abstract
          Data Types.</p>
          <p>Notice that programming could be reduced to <i>just 3
          visual patterns</i> - a sequence (again), a loop (which
          can be unfold into a sequence) and a “branch” which
          corresponds to a <i>conditional expression</i>, which, in
          turn, describes <i>alternative possibilities</i> (and
          this is what “forks” are).</p>
          <p>Notice also, that “forks” never arise in reality, only
          <i>in abstract models of some aspects of it</i>.</p>
          <p>An actual <i>sequence of “events”</i> always <i>goes
          through</i> one branch <i>OR</i> another and an
          alternative branch DOES NOT EXIST in <i>What Is</i> (it
          is a super-imposed abstraction by an external
          observer).</p>
          <p>So, it seems that <i>everything</i> is reducible to a
          sequence of discrete steps (or a sequrnce of
          <i>events</i>), which can be represented as connected
          arrows - <i>paths without forks or loops</i>.</p>
          <p>This is where you zoom to.</p>

      </div>
      <div id="outline-container-org3f60d62" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org3f60d62">Discrete Math</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3f60d62">
          <p>The good thing is that we need just <i>the very
          essence</i> of Discrete Math - the Set Theory, the
          Category Theory, the core of the Number Theory (that
          numbers are a generalized abstraction and could be viewed
          as having an abstract structure - <i>being a sum or a
          product or a weighed sum</i> of other numbers) and the
          Graph Theory (which captures and abstracts out pattens
          which arise in <i>What Is</i>, while most of the pure
          theoretical fancy bullshit (about possible categories of
          categories, for example) could be safely discarded (or
          pruned out).</p>
          <p>And this “locus” of universal pattens is what a good
          programmer should study.</p>
          <p>The reasoning above partially explains why pure
          functions and a list structure considered as the core of
          functional programming - almost everything could be
          reduced to them.</p>
          <p>Remember that a <i>table</i> is just an <i>a list of
          ordered pairs</i> (or a set of binary relations) and a
          <i>tree</i> is a list with more than one <i>tails</i>,
          and that a list itself is just a bunch nested pairs, and
          “conses” could be implemented as <i>lambdas</i>.</p>
          <p><i>All you need is Lambda</i> is another great
          fundamental result (by Alonzo Church), which confirms
          that everything is reducible to nesting of lambdas, which
          is <i>the only implementation</i> for <i>sequencing</i>
          (connected arrows!) in a Normal Order language.</p>
          <p>And this is the beg picture one has to have in one’s
          mind.</p>
          <p>This, by the way, implies that all these
          <i>gigabytes</i> of frameworks are, probably, unnecessay,
          redundant abstractions made by ignorant virtue-signalling
          idiots to bullshit their bosses and other people.</p>
