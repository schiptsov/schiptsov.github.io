I wrote all these pages in the span of a couple of months.
</p>

<p>
This implies I know some English, some Math, some Philosophy, some Functional Programming, some Haskell, some TLA+, some other languages, some Linux tools, etc.
</p>

<p>
I also completed back then the very first Machine Learning MOOC by
<i>Andrew Ng</i> with the score of <i>84%</i>, which proves that I <i>do know</i> some English, Math, Octave, etc.
</p>

<p>
My <a href="HN.html">HN</a> footprint is another indirect confirmation.
</p>

<p>
Lets say that I am <i>slightly</i> above average, at least judging by HN and
by the score, especially given that I am a college dropout and never
studied within an institution since then.
</p>

<p>
Yes, as you might have noticed, neither my English, nor my Math, nor my
Haskell are perfect, although my Eastern philosophy is solid.
</p>

<p>
So, if you are doing some research, I could do some <i>remote, asynchronous, from home</i> research for you for a fraction of money one would pay for an above average guy in US.

I used to be a top tier UNIX and Informix system administrator some 15 years ago.
