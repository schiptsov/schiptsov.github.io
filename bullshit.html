<h1 class="title">Bullshit</h1>
</header><p>
People love to produce and talk pseudo-scientific and &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo;
bullshit. I love to demolish it by collapsing everything back to <i>What Is</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is what I call ultimate <i>hacking</i> - eliminating bullshit and mental
confusion by never losing (or quickly regaining) &ldquo;ground of reality&rdquo;.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgec240a9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgec240a9">There is no such thing as a four dimension sphere.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgec240a9">
<p>
It is easy and seemingly &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;logical&rdquo; to just add one more number to a vector, and, wallah, we got another dimension.
</p>

<p>
And, you see, all the points at an equal distance from the center in all
4 dimensions implies (to them) that they have a sphere.
</p>

<p>
There is a subtlety, however. In two dimensions all the points at the same distance from the center has its own name - it is a circle. It seems that abstract thing in 4 dimensions should have a distinct name and therefore be distinct from a point, circle or sphere.
</p>

<p>
These who insist that this abstraction is also a sphere just abuse the proper use of a language.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org234c38d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org234c38d">Or a cube</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org234c38d">
<p>
Same argument goes for n-dimension cubes. Yes, we can imagine another perpendicular axis (which is where we cross into the realm of a pure bullshit) and, again, to have a vector with 4 elements in it.
</p>

<p>
However, there is no way to have 4th perpendicular axis unless it is purely imaginary one.
</p>

<p>
Lots of people convinced themselves that &ldquo;Time&rdquo; is such perpendicular axis (and a dimension) and created a lot of hymeras out of this assumption.
</p>

<p>
The subtlety is that this new axis have a <i>fundamentally different ruler</i> superimposed by a mind of an external observer onto it.
</p>

<p>
The mind works the same - it creates an arbitrary and abstract <i>unit</i> and then count in (sequences of) these units. &ldquo;Natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;logical&rdquo;, you know.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that they admit <i>dimensions of fundamentally different units</i> into a single abstract system and I do not.
</p>

<p>
I refuse to consider any 4th dimension as valid on the sole basis that I can imagine a vector of size 4 or more.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbd06eb8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbd06eb8">Or dimensions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd06eb8">
<p>
There is no dimensions in the first place - this is a mental concept of a mind conditioned by sequential sensory input. The first three dimensions are handy astract framework to deal with what we call <i>space</i> (by imagining a grid of dots, which is, of course, a generalized ruler).
</p>

<p>
I think this is the exact place to stop, meaning not going further in this direction, and to <i>prune</i> the whole tree of symbolic bullshit which grows further into deeper and deeper abstract bullshit.
</p>

<p>
You see, <i>pruning</i> is a rational operation. It is exactly the same notion as not to explore dead ends (or logically flawed arguments beyond a false statement) once you got a valid heuristic or found a logical error.
</p>

<p>
Collapsing bullshit back onto <i>What Is</i> - is what good philosophers arguably should do, instead of piling up abstract concepts into shaky caherdrals made out of turned and twisted abstract bullshit to impress poorly educated masses.
