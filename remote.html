    <p>Most of mathematics has been developed without fucking
    meetings. Mail correspondence (exchange of written down
    well-articulated thoughts on a paper) was good-enough. Journals
    (publishing) was a big deal too.</p>
    <p>Linux kernel is being successfully developed without fucking
    meetings. The complexity of this project way above a Boeing
    airliner or any other product created by a corporation. It is
    done by <i>systematic exchange of text files</i>.</p>
    <p>This means that your petty project could be done just by
    writing things down and a systematic workflow of texts. This is
    what makes locations (and fucking meetings with degens)
    irrelevant and even harmful.</p>
    <p>Last but not least, vastly complex cyber-criminal activities
    are “remote” and pseudo-anonymous, which is psychologically
    superior environments - less stress, less burden, less
    overwhelming, allows one to take time and write and <i>think
    slowly</i>, just like mathematicians of the past centuries.</p>
    <p>I work <i>only</i> remotely and alone. The only things you
    could get from me is some sort of structured <i>text</i>
    files/, in exchange for a <i>pre-paid subscription</i>.</p>
