    <p>Most of mathematics has been developed without fucking
    meetings. Mail correspondence (exchange of written down
    well-articulated thoughts on a paper) was good-enough. Journals
    (publishing) was a big deal too.</p>
    <p>Linux kernel is being successfully developed without fucking
    meetings. The complexity of this project way above a Boeing
    airliner or any other product created by a corporation. It is
    done by <i>systematic exchange of text files</i>.</p>
    <p>This means that your petty project could be done just by
    writing things down and a systematic workflow of texts. This is
    what makes locations (and fucking meetings with degens)
    irrelevant and even harmful.</p>
    <p>Last but not least, vastly complex cyber-criminal activities
    are “remote” and pseudo-anonymous, which is psychologically
    superior environments - less stress, less burden, less
    overwhelming, allows one to take time and write and <i>think
    slowly</i>, just like mathematicians of the past centuries.</p>
    <p>I work <i>only</i> remotely and alone. The only things you
    could get from me is some sort of structured <i>text files</i>,
    in exchange for a <i>pre-paid subscription</i>.</p>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org27986ce">
        <p>Just as GSM operators optimize for minimization of loses
        (after spending heavily on its network infrastructure) so I
        am optimizing for minimization of my own potential loses of
        time and money after spending heavily on education and
        development of an expertise.</p>
        <p>You (an organization of an individual CEO) presumably
        have a problem to be solved and a big budget for it. If you
        don’t have money allocated for this problem there is
        nothing to talk about.</p>
        <p>So, just lie with pre-paid GSM plans, there is no
        service unless you <i>pre-paid</i> for it. Just as a GSM
        network does not care what you use it for, I don’t care
        what will you do with my code, math or writings. I just
        provide (partial) solutions for sub-problems as long as
        payments are.</p>
        <p>If you are not satisfied you stop paying. If I receive
        no payments I stop working. It is that simple.</p>
        <p>There is no way you can influence me other than paying
        or not. I don’t even want to meet you (leave alone to
        participate in your meetings) just like GSM network
        technicians never meet any single customer in person.</p>
        <p>Individual, detailed protocols can be established for a
        particular business arrangements (which correspond to
        simplest possible contracts), but the main principle remain
        the same - of a pre-paid GSM network substitution.</p>
