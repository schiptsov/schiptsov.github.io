    <p>The real questions are what <i>underlies</i> math
    (<i>patterns</i> of actual reality, of course) and <i>why</i>
    it is what it is.</p>
    <p>For example, it is important to realize that the most
    fundamental operation is plain <i>addition</i> \(+\), and
    <i>everything else follows from it</i>.</p>
    <p>Addition, as an operation, is a generalization of a
    universal notion of <i>putting together</i>. \(H\) and \(O\)’s
    come (or being added) together to form an \(H_2{O}\) molecule.
    And <i>this</i> “addition” is <i>associative</i> (but is not a
    <i>closure</i>).</p>
    <p>BTW, especially for Haskell guys, this is a literal crossing
    of a type-boundary - individual “free” atoms became
    “<i>bound</i>” within a structure which has its own properties,
    bigger that merely a sum of its parts. The old-school guys of
    lambda Calculus, Combinatory Logic and early Lisps were onto
    something fundamental, and yes, this is what a
    <code>Monad</code> is - once atoms became parts of a
    <i>molecule</i> they “crossed an abstraction boundary (<i>to an
    external observer</i>) and actually <i>became</i> parts of
    something else (became bound)” while still remaining what they
    are (unchanged and immutable).</p>
    <p>Mother Nature does untyped programming. Actually, it does
    <i>structural typing</i> and does <i>structural
    pattern-matching</i> which is what old Lisp guys did with
    <i>type-tagging</i> and <i>type-casing</i> and math guys did
    with plain old <i>structural equality</i> which is, for us, a
    <i>simultaneous traversal</i> - the core of <i>universal
    pattern matching of the ML family of languages</i>, but comes
    “naturally” in the Universe.</p>
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>\(+\) is <i>associative</i> on any Set of Numbers, which
      implies a <i>closure property</i> on a Set under this
      operation.</li>
      <li>\(*\) (multiplication) is just repeated addition to
      itself. <i>Multiplication distributes over addition</i>
      precisely due to associativity of addition - every part of a
      <i>sum</i> is <i>scaled</i> in the same way and implicitly
      added (back) together.</li>
      <li>\(n^m\) (exponentiation) in turn is repeated
      multiplication by itself Its properties are due to its
      “nature”</li>
      <li>\(-\) (substation) is an <i>inverse</i> (or a reverse) of
      addition - just taking out what has been added (put
      together)</li>
      <li>\(/\) (division) is an <i>inverse</i> of multiplication,
      and from it some additional <i>properties</i> of whole
      Numbers could be derived.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is said that Natural Numbers have <i>structure</i>
    because they could be imagined as <i>sums</i> of other numbers
    (there are infinitely many of sums for every number if we
    consider negative integers).</p>
    <p>With products it is different - some Natural Numbers are NOT
    products of other numbers (lesser than itself). This is used to
    be a mysterious fact, but it only means that a pile cannot be
    taken apart into any number of smaller piles of <i>an equal
    size</i> (and this - of an equal size - is an important notion)
    which, in turn, means that they are NOT sums of any number of
    equally sized parts greater than 1 - which is just a special
    kind of a sum.</p>
    <p>There is nothing too deep about primes. First of all, they
    all are <i>odd</i> (not multiplies of 2, which implies not of
    any <i>even</i> number, and yes, 2 is very special), and by the
    same logic, they are not multiplies of any other primes (less
    but not equal than itself).</p>
    <p>What does it mean that a number is not a multiple of
    anything? It is not <i>rectangles</i> if we consider an
    abstract shape of a <i>product</i> - some leftovers (from a
    smaller rectangle) always “feels off” (or a bigger rectangle
    lacks a few “pieces” to be completed).</p>
    <p>A <i>sum</i>, by the way, could be viewed as a “linear
    structure”.</p>
    <p>And that is it - a pile cannot be taken into any number of
    equal parts (some <i>remainder</i> will always be left) and
    there is no way to spread the pile in a rectangular shape of
    any height (or width) - height 1 is a <i>line</i>.</p>
    <p>So, when we reduce products back to repeated sums it will
    tell us that a prime number is not a sum of any number of
    equally sized parts greater than 1.</p>
    <p>The <i>sieve algorithm</i> (which could be visualized as
    crossing off multiplies of a number lesser than it on line)
    sums it up and <i>operationally defines</i> everything that is
    <i>there</i> about primes. Geometric visualizations with piles
    (angles) and rectangles are just fancies.</p>
