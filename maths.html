The real questions are what <i>underlies</i> math (<i>patterns</i> of actual reality, of course) and <i>why</i> it is what it is.
</p>

<p>
For example, it is important to realize that the most fundamental
operation is plain <i>addition</i> \(+\), and <i>everything else follows from
it</i>.
</p>

<p>
A <i>number</i> is a genralized abstraction about <i>universal</i> property of a <i>pile</i>. Any pile, or pile of anything. It is how many <i>more than one</i> (or how many <i>ones</i>) is <i>in</i> it. A pile comes <i>prior</i> to associations and the abstract <i>number line</i>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that a <i>pile</i> is a generalized abstraction itself. The most general one. With little more imagination a single <i>piece</i> is a <i>pile</i> of just <i>one</i>, and, stretching imagination even more, when that <i>one</i> is <i>taken away</i> an <i>&ldquo;empty pile&rdquo;</i> is what &ldquo;remains&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
This is how the mind of an external observer produces its &ldquo;abstract concepts&rdquo; and this is <i>the universal basis</i> behind the Set Theory, and thus behind <i>all</i> of mathematics - <i>the mind of an external observer creates abstract concepts and superimposes them back upon What Is</i>.
</p>

<p>
When abstract concepts are <i>proper generalization</i> - it is <i>knowledge</i>, when they are <i>abstract bullshit</i> - it is <i>Maya</i> (a literal <i>weil</i> that hides and distorts reality <i>from itself</i>). Unnecessary, redundant abstractions is the root of all evil.
</p>

<p>
Addition, as an operation, is a generalization of a universal notion of
<i>putting together</i>. \(H\) and \(O\)&rsquo;s come (or being added) together to form an \(H_2{O}\) molecule. And <i>this</i> &ldquo;addition&rdquo; is <i>associative</i> (but is not a <i>closure</i>).
</p>

<p>
<i>Multiplication</i> is a repeated addition when we multiply by a <i>Natual Number</i>. It is even deep in a language - <i>multiple times</i>. Multiple times what? Add a number to itself.
</p>

<p>
When we multiply by a <i>Real Number</i> (especialy less than \(1\)) this operation is <i>scaling</i> and when the numner is less than <i>one</i> is best understood in terms of <i>division</i> which is, <i>splitting into equal parts</i> (with a possible remainder).
</p>

<p>
Notice that here <i>equal parts</i> is crucial - it corresponds to <i>adding to itself</i> multiple times.
</p>

<p>
When we <i>scale</i> by, say, \(0.5\) we scale by a <i>half</i>, which means <i>division</i> by \(2\). And this is the basis of the abstract notion of <i>percentage</i>. By convention we split into \(100\) equal parts and then take some.
</p>

<p>
In this case one splits a given number in \(n\) equal pieces, selects some \(m\) pieces (out of \(n\)) and <i>substracts</i> from the number. When \(m = n\) it is just \(1\) - no scaling. When it is \(0.5\) we subtract a <i>half</i>.
</p>

<p>
This, by the way, is where the general notion of <i>a weighted sum</i> comes from, which is, arguably, is the most common generalized abstraction - one adds up <i>scaled terms</i> (each term scaled by its own <i>miltiplier</i> (or a scalar), which could be \(1\) - no scaling is done - an ideintiy of multiplication, or \(0\) - turns term to &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;, and zero is identity of addition).
</p>

<p>
And a <i>polynomial</i> is a <i>specialization</i> of a <i>weighted sum</i>, by adding more rules of what kind of terms should be added together, and that some terms may be <i>negative</i>. And then the whole hell of <i>algebraic numbers</i> broken lose.
</p>

<p>
Notice also that we could say than numbers had a <i>strucure</i> - they could be viewd as a <i>sum</i> of other numbers, a <i>product</i> or even a <i>polynomial</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Primeness</i> of a number means that it is NOT some other number added to
itself any number of times (there is always some reminder left). And
that is just it. Everything else is bullshit. Just not a <i>multiple</i> of
any other number - <i>a pile which cannot be divided into any number of
equal parts (smaller piles of equal size)</i>.
</p>

<p>
In everything in Nature a <i>more than one</i> is an <i>aggregate</i> and it has its own <i>particular structure</i> - how exactly <i>one and another one</i> held together.
</p>

<p>
This is the universal basis of <i>typing</i> - not everything could be added to everything else and resulting <i>aggregates</i> is NOT the same.
</p>

<p>
Molecules (aggregates of atoms) are (literally) <i>structureally typed</i>. So are aggregates of molecules (linear or other kinds of structures).
Typing is an universal notion and Lisp guys got it right back then.
</p>

<p>
BTW, especially for Haskell guys, this is a literal crossing of a
type-boundary - individual &ldquo;free&rdquo; atoms became &ldquo;<i>bound</i>&rdquo; within a
structure which has its own properties, bigger that merely a sum of its
parts. The old-school guys of lambda Calculus, Combinatory Logic and early Lisps were onto something fundamental, and yes, this is what a <code>Monad</code> is metaphysically - once atoms became parts of a <i>molecule</i> they &ldquo;crossed an abstraction boundary (<i>to an external observer</i>) and actually <i>became</i> parts of something else (became bound)&rdquo; while still remaining what they are (unchanged and immutable).
</p>

<p>
Mother Nature does untyped programming. Actually, it does <i>structural typing</i> and does <i>structural pattern-matching</i> which is what old Lisp guys did with <i>type-tagging</i> and <i>type-casing</i> and math guys did with plain old <i>structural equality</i> which is, for us, a <i>simultaneous traversal</i> - the core of <i>universal pattern matching of the ML family of languages</i>, but comes &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; in the Universe.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(+\) is <i>associative</i> on any Set of Numbers, which implies a <i>closure
property</i> on a Set under this operation.</li>
<li>\(*\) (multiplication) is just repeated addition to itself.
<i>Multiplication distributes over addition</i> precisely due to
associativity of addition - every part of a <i>sum</i> is <i>scaled</i> in the
same way and implicitly added (back) together.</li>
<li>\(n^m\) (exponentiation) in turn is repeated multiplication by itself
Its properties are due to its &ldquo;nature&rdquo;</li>
<li>\(-\) (substation) is an <i>inverse</i> (or a reverse) of addition - just
taking out what has been added (put together)</li>
<li>\(/\) (division) is an <i>inverse</i> of multiplication, and from it some
additional <i>properties</i> of whole Numbers could be derived.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is said that Natural Numbers have <i>structure</i> because they could be
imagined as <i>sums</i> of other numbers (there are infinitely many of sums
for every number if we consider negative integers).
</p>

<p>
With products it is different - some Natural Numbers are NOT products of
other numbers (lesser than itself). This is used to be a mysterious fact,
but it only means that a pile cannot be taken apart into any number
of smaller piles of <i>an equal size</i> (and this - of an equal size - is an
important notion) which, in turn, means that they are NOT sums of
any number of equally sized parts greater than 1 - which is just a
special kind of a sum.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing too deep about primes. First of all, they all are
<i>odd</i> (not multiplies of 2, which implies not of any <i>even</i> number, and
yes, 2 is very special), and by the same logic, they are not
multiplies of any other primes (less but not equal than itself).
</p>

<p>
What does it mean that a number is not a multiple of anything? It is not
<i>rectangles</i> if we consider an abstract shape of a <i>product</i> - some
leftovers (from a smaller rectangle) always &ldquo;feels off&rdquo; (or a bigger
rectangle lacks a few &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; to be completed).
</p>

<p>
A <i>sum</i>, by the way, could be viewed as a &ldquo;linear structure&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
And that is it - a pile cannot be taken into any number of equal parts
(some <i>remainder</i> will always be left) and there is no way to spread the
pile in a rectangular shape of any height (or width) - height 1 is a
<i>line</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, when we reduce products back to repeated sums it will tell us that a
prime number is not a sum of any number of equally sized parts greater
than 1.
</p>

<p>
The <i>sieve algorithm</i> (which could be visualized as crossing off
multiplies of a number lesser than it on line) sums it up and
<i>operationally defines</i> everything that is <i>there</i> about primes.
Geometric visualizations with piles (angles) and rectangles are just
fancies.
