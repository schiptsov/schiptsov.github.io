These things makes everything more difficult because one has to be a real expert
to catch the bullshit inevitably introduced by the way (the algorithm) these
services generate the sequences of whatever.
</p>

<p>
A <i>model</i> does not build up from the first principles and does not check or
evaluate anything for correctness. It just generates based on some abstract
distance or frequency-based heuristic with a bit of randomness, to impose as an
expert.
</p>

<p>
Ordinary coder will not even notice a flaw or a problem because one has <i>no idea</i>
that there could be a flaw.
</p>

<p>
It is just, literally, like <i>copy-pasting code from public forums</i> without
understanding. The code that is <i>not written by you bottom-up from the first
principles</i> is a random potential disaster.
</p>

<p>
And yes, a <i>co-pilot</i> may change a few symbols. It does not have any semantic (or
of any kind) knowledge whatsoever. Everything is just some abstract distance
heuristics, of not even vowels or morphemes.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing is literally an illusion of &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; &#x2013; an <i>artifical imposer</i>.
</p>

<p>
All this is not an emotional alarmism, triggered by something unfamiliar and
disturbing. Unlike most of you I do understand the underlying algorithms and
techniques. It generates very convincing bullshit.
