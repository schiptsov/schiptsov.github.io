<h1 class="title">Li Haoyi</h1>
</header><p>
<i>Li Haoyi</i> is the man who by his own efforts lifted the whole Scala ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing to learn from him is his strive for <i>simple</i>,
<i>minimal</i> but &ldquo;just right&rdquo; abstractions, as in his <code>castor</code> library, and the
wisdom of just &ldquo;porting&rdquo; well-designed and battle-tested APIs and
proper abstractions from Python.
</p>

<p>
By being principle-guided and by focusing on &ldquo;just right&rdquo; abstractions
and minimalism he managed to become immensely <i>productive</i> by <i>writing less</i>.
</p>

<p>
He also has a very precise and concise writing style, and he wrote an
advanced book, based on what he is doing.
</p>

<p>
He can be legitimately compared to <i>John Carmack</i> in his striving to do
everything just right, attention to details and productivity.
</p>

<p>
Again, programming is about <i>just right abstractions</i>, not the code per
se, and this fundamental principle has been well-researched and taught
in 70s and 80s by Barbara Liskov and her CLU language, which, unlike Java, has most of
things right.
