Just like the field of psychology left behind abstract Freudian bullshit
and became <i>evolutionary</i> and <i>experimental</i> (Milgram), the field of economics (and
trading) is slowly abandoning its own abstract bullshit an naive assumptions
(rational, intelligent agents maximize their expected returns using
optimizations, independence of observable events, stable, unchanging
probabilities and variance, etc.) and evolved into <i>behavioral</i>, by
selecting human emotions and <i>crowd behavior</i> as primary driving forces.
Markets are driven by memes and FOMO in the age of Robinhood and FTX.
</p>

<p>
All sophisticated mathematical models based on abstract economic
theories (based on naive, idialistic assumptions) are wrong, plain and
simple. Not a single hedge fund, stuffed with PhDs to the brim ever posted
a statistically significant returns consistently outperforming the
market. Everything can be attributed to plain luck plus diversification.
FTX was <i>very</i> lucky for a long time, riding a bull market. Every one can be
a genius in a bull mania phase.
</p>

<p>
So, the main pont is to discard all idealistic views and naive
assumptions and see markets as they are - huge crowds of degens swayed
back and forth by memes on social media (the Elder school, to which I
proudly belong).

<h2 id="org2282223">Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2282223">
<p>
In general, one has to have deep pockets (and proper money management)
to survive in the market as long as possible, till he gets somehow lucky
(by being prepared).
</p>

<p>
Just like it is with Boxing, one will be hit <i>a lot</i> (and has to be ok
with taking hits), and the main virtue is <i>endurance and alertness</i> for
not missing a chance. One has to be able to stand up for 12 rounds.
It is that simple.
</p>

<p>
The major cause of loses is <i>over-trading</i> (second only to the plain
stupidity). By trading too much (especially inside ranges) one goes
against the law of large numbers in a riged, manipulated <i>minus-sum
game</i> especially designed to confuse and inflict loses. The mantra is <i>trade less, but just right</i>.
