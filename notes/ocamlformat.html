</header><p>
Can we just stop that <i>outrageous idiocy</i> of automatically converting small
functions into a singe line when it, please?
</p>

<p>
First, <code>Ocaml</code> is not <code>Go</code> and the one enforced formatting for all code
cannot be applied here. <code>Go</code> is especially designed to be &ldquo;primitive&rdquo;,
while Ocaml has long <i>tradition</i> and several <i>cultures</i> which goes back to
<code>ML</code>.
</p>

<p>
Second, there is a couple of <i>fundamental principles</i>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Data values have its unique shapes (which is reflected in types).</li>
<li>The shape of <i>functions</i> tends to reflect the shape of <i>values</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Functions on <i>recursive types</i> tend to be recursive and thus to have a
particular shape which can be seen at a glance.
</p>

<p>
Functions on <i>sum-types</i> (defined by pattern-matching on
data-constructors, which is <i>the</i> way) reflect the <i>exact shape</i> of the type
declaration.
</p>

<p>
Again, converting small types and small functions into one-liners
is outrageously stupid. It just throws the <i>shape information</i> and
<i>syntactic form clues</i> out of the window for literally nothing.
</p>

<p>
There is a long tradition of writing <i>multy-clause</i> functions by
pattern-matching in at least <code>Standard ML</code> and <code>Erlang</code>.  <code>Ocaml</code> also has the
<code>function</code> syntactic form because it is convenient.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the seemingly archaic term <i>syntactic form</i> is what we are dealing with,
and it is just stupid to <i>dismiss</i> this rich and useful concept because
zoomers don&rsquo;t know it.
</p>

<p>
The whole point of having a tool such as <code>ocamlformat</code> is <i>to support
multiple choices</i>, not to reduce everything to an one-fits-all style. Again,
this is not <code>Go</code>. At least we should have an <i>option</i>.
</p>

<p>
Functional languages tend to have many syntactic forms, even if we cannot
just create new ones, like we could with <i>Lisp macros</i>. Again, this is part of the culture.
</p>

<p>
So, come on.
