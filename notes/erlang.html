<h1 class="title">Erlang</h1>
</header><p>
Unlike SML, Erlang has <i>heterogeneous lists</i> and <i>type-tagged values</i>, just like
Common Lisp or Scheme.
</p>

<p>
Just like Haskell and lately Python, Erlang has <i>purely declarative list comprehensions</i>, which can be traced back to the mathematical notation, developed within the Set Theory (the basis for all mathematics).
</p>

<p>
Being <i>declarative</i> with a high-level DSL is the highest possible level of excellence. Besides <i>set comprehensions</i>, summations and integrals are examples of such declarative notations.
</p>

<p>
We, in programming, use DSLs, sometimes as beautiful and close to math as Scala&rsquo;s <code>scalatest</code> set of libraries or the original <code>quickcheck</code> for Haskell.
</p>

<p>
Erlang lacks some abilities of expressing DSLs due to neglect of syntax. Currying and partial application + the ability to define arbitrary infix operators is what it is lacking.
</p>

<p>
User-facing subset of Erlang is <i>pure functional</i>. <code>send</code>  is an <i>infix operator</i> and
acts like an <i>identity</i> function. <code>recieve</code> is like a <i>multi-clause</i> &ldquo;function&rdquo; (it is
<i>pure with respect to the pattern</i> and a given <i>context</i>).
</p>

<p>
<code>spawn</code> is a pure as <code>apply</code>.
</p>

<p>
Just like SML, <i>pattern-matching</i> is the main mechanism of dealing with structured and <i>nested</i>
values.
</p>

<p>
Erlang pioneered <i>universal pattern-matching</i> (first introduced in SML),
which means patterns are <i>everywhere</i>.
</p>

<p>
<code>=</code> is not an &ldquo;assignment&rdquo;, but binds <i>unbound</i> symbols or is an &ldquo;assertion&rdquo; for both
sides of <code>=</code> to have the same shape with exactly the same values. SML uses <code>let</code>.
</p>

<p>
Patterns could appear in <i>list comprehensions</i> for both <i>descructuring</i> and <i>constructing</i>.
</p>

<p>
Function <i>clauses</i> (which SML also have) also <i>defined by pattern-matching</i>. Thus
each clause becomes a <i>partial function</i> (defined only on a particular subset of
the domain).
</p>

<p>
Functions with more that one <i>clause</i> are usually defined for <i>algebraic sum-types</i>,
and the overall <i>shape</i> of a function follows to the shape of a data-type.
</p>

<p>
Unlike SML, Erlang does not support <i>currying</i> and <i>partial application</i>.
</p>

<p>
Pattern-matching on <code>receive</code> is Erlang&rsquo;s unique innovation. This allows to
examine the <i>shape</i> of received data, destructure and <i>bind</i> to symbols.
</p>

<p>
Each <code>receive</code> clause is a partial &ldquo;function&rdquo; with &ldquo;arguments&rdquo; being <i>bound</i> by the
pattern-matching process.
</p>

<p>
the <code>[H|T]</code> syntax. In a pattern it <i>unpacks and binds</i>, in an expression it
<i>constructs</i>.
</p>

<p>
We can easily add tests and perform <i>test-driven development</i> without any
additional tools. All we need is /pattern matching and <code>=</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>result (self-evaluating) = expression</code>
</p>

<p>
this is an implicit <i>assertion</i> about <i>structured values</i> (of the same shape).
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t handle the case where no pattern matchesâ€”our
program will fail with a runtime error. /This is deliberate. This is the way we
program in Erlang. (Fail fast!)
