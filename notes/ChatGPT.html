Oh, yes, yes. This mass hysteria on HN.
</p>

<p>
There is what you would have. The inability, in principle, to trust any written
text because you cannot be sure it isn&rsquo;t coming from one of these <i>bullshit
verbiage synthesizers</i>.
</p>

<p>
Again, what a model &ldquo;learns&rdquo; is the actual shape of the current snapshot of
<i>verbiage noise</i> given to it a training sets.
</p>

<p>
With the <code>code</code> that it is able to generate the situation is exactly the same. One
have to exercise <i>formal methods</i> to make sure that it is correct.
</p>

<p>
Some people already said that just <i>code-reviews</i> by real experts will solve the
problem, but it wont. There the Dijkstra&rsquo;s principle that tests never show
the absence of bugs will shine again.
</p>

<p>
One more time. It outputs &ldquo;what looks like&rdquo; the correct code, it never produces
the code from the first principles, using standard idioms and best
practices. It just <i>searches</i> within its trained structure.
</p>

<p>
So, no. Fundamentally it all the code it returns at the prompts should be
formally verified because it is not produced by a <i>bottom-up</i> process which is
preceded by a carefully selecting most relevant concepts and abstracting them
out in an optimal (minimal and just right) way.
</p>

<p>
When one prompts it to &ldquo;write a ray-tracer using opengl&rdquo; it never goes through
all the vastly complex, tens of layers deep (evolved by the process of <i>trial and
error</i> and <i>biased selection</i> by thousands of humans) conceptual framework. It just
spews out the code with the best &ldquo;weights&rdquo;. It is a search through ready made
snippets (it was trained with), after all.
</p>

<p>
It does not &ldquo;create&rdquo; even the simplest code in any sense. It returns it.
