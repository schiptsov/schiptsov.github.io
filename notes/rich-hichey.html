<p>
When he came out with <code>Clojure</code> and his very first video lectures, I
studied <i>MIT Scheme</i> and <i>Common Lisp</i> by reading the classic books.
</p>

<p>
Being still a green amateur I <i>intuitively</i> realized very quicky that he just
ripped off all the principles behind Scheme and some of Common Lisp,
reshuffled, and put together as something of his own invention. Yes, I
was naive and amateur, I told you.
</p>

<p>
So, I just dismissed him as <i>yet another narcissistic asshole</i> and moved
on, largely ignoring <i>the actual details</i> of what he was saying.
</p>

<p>
Today I&rsquo;ve understood that I was simply unprepared to that kind of
 presentation and joggling with familiar principles and classic concepts.
</p>

<p>
He is right, you like it or not, and he did what he did - restated old
principles from Functional Programming in Scheme and Imperative in
Common Lisp, added some common sense and repackaged it as a <i>simple</i> (
presumably done just right) language for the JVM platform to hide behind
proper classic abstractions and techiques the fucking degeneracy of the Java language and
<i>imperative OOP</i> in general. I have understood this much back then.
</p>

<p>
Today I would say that I really appreciate that he have done what he preached.
The Datomic database (of all things) has been developed on the
principles <i>and using the language based on these principles</i>, and it is a
success. Immutability and persistence wasn&rsquo;t just memes.
</p>

<p>
This is actually big. This re-qualifies Rich from just a narcissistic
asshole who loves to hear his voice, to a successful designer and
architect similar (but obviously inferior) to Joe Armstrong, who is a
real icon.
