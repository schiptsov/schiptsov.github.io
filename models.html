<i>All models are wrong (over-simplification, over-generalization) but some
are useful.</i>
</p>

<p>
A model is a oversimplified, seemingly &ldquo;logical&rdquo; conceptual framework
<i>superimposed by the minds of an observer</i> onto vastly complex aspects of
reality, too overwhelming with details and <i>dynamic</i> multiple causation
for the mind to deal with.
</p>

<p>
A model is, at best, a useful (usable) <i>approximation</i> to make imperfect
judgments.
</p>

<p>
<i>Linear</i> models (a straight line), <i>averages</i>, weights (coefficients) and
<i>weighted /sums</i> are the most obvious examples.
</p>

<p>
It is crucial to realize that even the simplest models <i>lose information</i>
and therefore increase a &ldquo;distance&rdquo; from what actually is, so the more
complex and more abstract the model is the more it is &ldquo;removed&rdquo; from
actual reality.
</p>

<p>
Yes, &ldquo;zooming out&rdquo; and taking a &ldquo;bird-eye view&rdquo; is a very useful
tactics, but one must realize that this &ldquo;bigger picture&rdquo; is a results of
&ldquo;aggregated effects&rdquo;, and is different from what is.
</p>

<p>
The universal examples are clouds, galaxies and other <i>processes</i> observed
from a distance. When one zooms in inside the cloud (of a galaxy) it
disappears. Individual water droplets have no idea (so to speak) that
they are inside a cloud or <i>related</i> to others.
</p>

<p>
In other words, an observer might have deduced (inferred) <i>relations</i> that
are not there.
</p>

<p>
However, most of simple models, when applied to the right environments
and processes, capturing the <i>real (actual, non-imaginary, non-abstract)
metrics</i> provide a useful insights.
</p>

<p>
The most useful examples are averages and  &ldquo;trend lines&rdquo; of complex
weather patterns, which show (visualize) <i>recurring patterns</i> and hint on
the causality. Just annual temperature and rainfall averages describe
approximate conditions of a location.
</p>

<p>
Recurring patterns <i>re-emerge</i> (never identical, never exactly the same)
from <i>apparent chaos</i> due to recurring causal <i>conditions</i>. This is the main
lemma of the law of causality.
</p>

<p>
Notice that fitting the lines or simple curves to the data is always
wrong because lines and curves does not capture the actual multiple
causality and that the causal factors are in a constant flux.
</p>

<p>
The old factors lose its &ldquo;weights&rdquo;, while new ones emerge, new
<i>combinations</i> (arrangements) form, the whole system constantly
evolves, adapts and even &ldquo;learns&rdquo; (the simplest learning is memory of
what to avoid).
</p>

<p>
So, do not take models for reality (you will end up disillusioned and
failed). Models are just useful mental tools, and only the simplest
models &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Complexity of modeling produces <i>sophisticated bullshit</i>.

<h2 id="orgfd93da8">Lists</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd93da8">
<p>
Just <i>listing</i> (writing down) things produces the simplest (but imperfect)
model. This is, of course, related to the most general notion of a <i>Set</i>.
</p>

<p>
One might end up with an incomplete list (or a Set) so the model will be
inevitably flawed, but in some cases, when what is left out is
insignificant or almost irrelevant, is will be useful (better than
having none).
</p>

<p>
Attaching &ldquo;weights&rdquo; to the elements, and ordering them (according to the
weights or other factors) produce abstractions like <i>priority queues</i>.

<h2 id="orgb098b7c">Distances</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb098b7c">
<p>
Analyzing &ldquo;weights&rdquo; produce the simple (the ones which only work)
stats, based on <i>distances</i> from the mean or an actual measure.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the notion of a distance is at the very core of physical
reality.
</p>

<p>
Proper statistics just capture patterns, never create any abstract
bullshit. At least this is how it ought to be.
</p>

<h2 id="orgbe07b93">Disappearing mount trails</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbe07b93">
<p>
Just like mountain trails which begin wide and bold tend diminish and
eventually disappear at the heights where is literally <i>nothing</i>, but
stones and air (and snow), so are the abstract bullshit theories.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;lines of thoughts&rdquo;, which began bold and definitive tends to
disappear at a higher and higher levels of abtraction where <i>there is
literally nothing</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is not just a beautiful metaphor. This is how things are.
