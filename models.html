    <p><i>All models are wrong (over-simplification,
    over-generalization) but some are useful.</i></p>
    <p>A model is a oversimplified, seemingly “logical” conceptual
    framework <i>superimposed by the minds of an observer</i> onto
    vastly complex aspects of reality, too overwhelming with
    details and <i>dynamic</i> multiple causation for the mind to
    deal with.</p>
    <p>A model is, at best, a useful (usable) <i>approximation</i>
    to make imperfect judgments.</p>
    <p><i>Linear</i> models (a straight line), <i>averages</i>,
    weights (coefficients) and <i>weighted /sums</i> are the most
    obvious examples.</p>
    <p>It is crucial to realize that even the simplest models
    <i>lose information</i> and therefore increase a “distance”
    from what actually is, so the more complex and more abstract
    the model is the more it is “removed” from actual reality.</p>
    <p>Yes, “zooming out” and taking a “bird-eye view” is a very
    useful tactics, but one must realize that this “bigger picture”
    is a results of “aggregated effects”, and is different from
    what is.</p>
    <p>The universal examples are clouds, galaxies and other
    <i>processes</i> observed from a distance. When one zooms in
    inside the cloud (of a galaxy) it disappears. Individual water
    droplets have no idea (so to speak) that they are inside a
    cloud or <i>related</i> to others.</p>
    <p>In other words, an observer might have deduced (inferred)
    <i>relations</i> that are not there.</p>
    <p>However, most of simple models, when applied to the right
    environments and processes, capturing the <i>real (actual,
    non-imaginary, non-abstract) metrics</i> provide a useful
    insights.</p>
    <p>The most useful examples are averages and “trend lines” of
    complex weather patterns, which show (visualize) <i>recurring
    patterns</i> and hint on the causality. Just annual temperature
    and rainfall averages describe approximate conditions of a
    location.</p>
    <p>Recurring patterns <i>re-emerge</i> (never identical, never
    exactly the same) from <i>apparent chaos</i> due to recurring
    causal <i>conditions</i>. This is the main lemma of the law of
    causality.</p>
    <p>Notice that fitting the lines or simple curves to the data
    is always wrong because lines and curves does not capture the
    actual multiple causality and that the causal factors are in a
    constant flux.</p>
    <p>The old factors lose its “weights”, while new ones emerge,
    new <i>combinations</i> (arrangements) form, the whole system
    constantly evolves, adapts and even “learns” (the simplest
    learning is memory of what to avoid).</p>
    <p>So, do not take models for reality (you will end up
    disillusioned and failed). Models are just useful mental tools,
    and only the simplest models “works”. Complexity of modeling
    produces <i>sophisticated bullshit</i>.</p>

      <h2 id="org983d3ee">Lists</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org983d3ee">
        <p>Just <i>listing</i> (writing down) things produces the
        simplest (but imperfect) model. This is, of course, related
        to the most general notion of a <i>Set</i>.</p>
        <p>One might end up with an incomplete list (or a Set) so
        the model will be inevitably flawed, but in some cases,
        when what is left out is insignificant or almost
        irrelevant, is will be useful (better than having
        none).</p>
        <p>Attaching “weights” to the elements, and ordering them
        (according to the weights or other factors) produce
        abstractions like <i>priority queues</i>.</p>

      <h2 id="orgf4b06ac">Distances</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf4b06ac">
        <p>Analyzing “weights” produce the simple (the ones which
        only work) stats, based on <i>distances</i> from the mean
        or an actual measure.</p>
        <p>Notice that the notion of a distance is at the very core
        of physical reality.</p>
        <p>Proper statistics just capture patterns, never create
        any abstract bullshit. At least this is how it ought to
        be.</p>
