<h1 class="title">Trigonometry</h1>
</header><p>
I went to 3 different trashy soviet schools (because of bullying) and none of these taught mathematics properly. All they did was showing you a crappy soviet textbook full of formulas to memorize. I still remember my struggling with trigonometry because no one bothered to explain to us what it is all about.
</p>

<p>
This is, probably, the most fascinating story on Earth - how humans generalize and abstract out recurring patterns they observe. I am not in a position to tell it, but at least I could say a few words.
</p>

<p>
Mind creates abstract <i>concepts</i> and from these concepts the whole <i>conceptual frameworks</i>. What we call <i>branches of mathematics</i> (almost everything beyond arithmetic and <i>Natural Numbers</i>) are development of this or that particular conceptual framework.
</p>

<p>
Back to trigonometry. The tradition says that ancient Greeks, those exempt from
a forced slave labor and concerns about where the food will come from, have studied <i>shapes</i> (drawn with a stick on the soil).
</p>

<p>
One of such fundamental shapes (besides a <i>straight line</i> and a <i>right triangle</i>) is a <i>circle</i>, which they used to draw using a stick and a piece of rope. They even developed the special instrument to draw circles precisely.
</p>

<p>
So <i>what</i> is a circle? Well, it is what we see shining in the sky above our heads. To be precise - it is a generalization and then an a well-defined abstraction of what we see in the sky.
</p>

<p>
For these ancient Greeks it was a <i>all points</i> at the same particular distance
from the center (at the length of a rope). They have no concept of a <i>Set</i> back then.
</p>

<p>
So, this is an abstraction, which involves <i>a distance</i> from the center. Abstraction of What?
</p>

<p>
Well, there is a universal notion (which we, intelligent observers, can observe and <i>generalize from</i>) of a <i>distance</i>. In any human language this notion has been captured by &ldquo;how far&rdquo; or &ldquo;how close&rdquo; something is from the other.
</p>

<p>
This notion is universal because, it turns out, something what we call a &ldquo;force&rdquo;
(a pull, so to speak) diminishes with (proportional to) a <i>square of a distance</i>.
So, our abstracted notion of a <i>distance</i> is indeed based on &ldquo;something real&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
<i>This</i> is why we see some spheres in the sky and all the other spheres - this
shape emerges from a process which involves distances from the center. Our
generalizations and abstractions of a circle (as a projection of a sphere) turns
out to be &ldquo;perfectly captured&rdquo; (just right).
</p>

<p>
Our minds can &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; measure lengths in terms of straight sticks (because
these naturally occur in our shared environment) by superimposing it as a &ldquo;unit&rdquo;
of length and then counting how many units it takes.
</p>

<p>
In our language-based shared culture we have developed a <i>standard methodology</i>
for measurements - to <i>superimpose</i> an imaginary &ldquo;scale&rdquo; or a &ldquo;grid&rdquo; upon
everything we observe. The tradition says that it was Descartes who developed
this methodology in a systematic way, for what we nowadays call a &ldquo;coordinate system&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
So, to study an abstract (generalized, ideal) circle, one imagines and superimposes a &ldquo;coordinate system&rdquo; upon it, in a way that <i>the origin</i> co-insides with the center of a circle. One also assumes (imagines) that the <i>radius of a circle</i> is an one single unit (of the scale). This is what we call a <i>unit circle</i>.
</p>

<p>
We also need a concept of an <i>angle</i>. This is another generalized abstraction, and
has its own superimposed &ldquo;scale&rdquo; of measurement of a &ldquo;degree&rdquo; of an angle (you
can think of a bent or curved &ldquo;scale ruler&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
In the case of modal arithmetic, by the way, the scale ruler (the Number Line)
turned into a <i>spiral</i> and being read up from the top. Anyway.
</p>

<p>
The universal notion we have <i>captured, generalized and then abstracted out</i> with the concept of an angle is how it differs from a <i>perpendicular</i> or a <i>flat line</i>. There too are readily occur in our shared environment - certain kinds of trees versus a flat surface of the soul.
</p>

<p>
Tradition holds that a perpendicular corresponds to the <i>90 degrees</i>, and that such angle (versus the horizontal surface) is called the <i>right angle</i>.
</p>

<p>
Again, they were onto something real, because what we call <i>orthogonality</i> is a
special property - it is sort of the <i>&ldquo;longest distance&rdquo;</i> from the <i>surface</i>. Yes, a <i>distance</i> again.
</p>

<p>
Greeks considered it as a special <i>line</i>, which is what a <i>perpendicular</i> is a name of, and it is <i>unique</i> (there is <i>only one</i> such line through any point). 
</p>

<p>
Now, when we have all these concepts and have superimposed our coordinate system (Greeks do not call it this way, of course) we can observe <i>emergent abstract patterns</i>.
</p>

<p>
The observed that each point on a <i>unit circle</i> (which has exactly the same distance from the center) has its own unique (different from all other) <i>projection</i> onto each <i>axis</i>.
</p>

<p>
The difference is due to the <i>angle</i> between the radius - a line from this point (to the center) and the axis (one and the another).
</p>

<p>
This is what we call a <i>relation</i> or an <i>unique correspondence</i> between two measured observations.
</p>

<p>
This is a mapping from an angle (in its units) to a distance from the axis or the length of a perpendicular (in its units).
</p>

<p>
Tradition chooses to call the functions (particular mappings) from an angle to <i>the length of a projection</i> to the axis &#x2013; <i>sine</i> for the X-axis and co-sine for the Y-axis.
</p>

<p>
The formalism of a &ldquo;right triangle&rdquo; (based on the Pythagorean theorem) is used to calculate the actual lengths.
</p>

<p>
This is how to begin to teach what is behind these cryptic strings of <code>Sin</code> and
<code>Cos</code>.
</p>

<p>
Everything has to be explained from the <i>first principles</i>, so all the formulas
and underlying relations can be <i>sort of re-discovered</i> instead of <i>merely
memorized</i> (which is what <i>bad</i> soviet teaching was all about).
</p>

<p>
Knowing the principles frees one from memerizing all the details. This is how
mathematics should be taught - to always zoom in and out from the observed
recurring pattern, to a generalization, to an abstraction and its properties and
&ldquo;laws&rdquo;.
