The most common learning is by <i>imitating what others do</i> and by gaining your own experience through repeated practice. This is universal &#x2013; animals learn that way.
</p>

<p>
Most of the learning amounts to &ldquo;having had <i>this</i> (or the same) problem before&rdquo;. This is basically what almost all professional skill-sets are in practice.
</p>

<h2 id="orga272a4a">Practical</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga272a4a">
<p>
Just like a practicing doctor or motorcycle mechanic, one becomes <i>familiar</i> and eventually
<i>experienced</i> which common situation which frequently arise. This
is a similar to a practical knowledge of a musician or a craftsman or
a tennis player.
</p>

<p>
I am a system administrator for my first career, with lots of SCO Unix,
FreeBSD (using ports instead of packages) and early RedHat under my
belt, and I am still using Gentoo <i>daily</i>, which is also based on building things from the sources.
</p>

<p>
After all that <i>experience</i> I do not even remember when something got
broken which I cannot troubleshot or fix. And I do things like compiling
a whole Haskell stack (including <code>stack</code>, you know) from the sources.
</p>

<p>
This is because I internalized the principles (dynamic linking, package
versioning, and &ldquo;anatomy&rdquo; of a <code>C/C++</code> project in general) and have
done certain things so many times that I don&rsquo;t even think about it.
</p>

<p>
Such level, however, takes some 20 years of daily <i>practice</i>, and this is
just exactly the same as being a <i>truck driver</i> for 20 years.

<h2 id="org63c14cc">Principles</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org63c14cc">
<p>
The most valuable knowledge is of <i>general principles</i> and their implications (consequences).
</p>

<p>
Knowing some fundamental principles of physics saves a lot of time and effort by pruning out (not trying) what will not work. This is how smart people do troubleshuting &#x2013; by starting from the principles.
</p>

<p>
This is a universal technique of <i>reducing the search space</i> for an informed search (which use <i>stable heuristics</i>).
</p>

<p>
So, we absolutely have to learn and understand the principles of programming in general (MIT used to teach pricniples with Scheme-based courses) in order not to be drowned in irrelevant particulars of current mass-hysteria (react.js, async Python and what not).
</p>

<p>
*Going into unknown
What is fundamentally different is <i>&ldquo;going into unknown&rdquo;</i> &#x2013; doing something of which you do not have previous experience or memorized knowledge.
</p>

<p>
But we are doing this all the time on a small scale, by visiting unfamiliar places and meeting new people (no wonder this gives some a lot of anxiety!).
</p>

<p>
Exploratory mathematics and programming are the most difficult things, because one has to verify every single step (transition).
</p>


<p>
Memorised imperative knowledge
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to use Vim
This includes <i>principles</i>, like &ldquo;navigate through the <i>structure</i> of a text, <i>not by using arrows or <code>hjkl</code></i>.</li>
<li>How to use Emacs
Understand that each keypress invokes a function, familiarize yourself with major <i>modes</i>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Recepies
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You know how to make some foods without spoiling it.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0fa16a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb0fa16a">Expert knowledge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0fa16a">
<p>
An expert knowledge goes beyond &ldquo;how-tos&rdquo; and &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; in general. It
is beyond imperative knowledge of the domain and related mathematics.
</p>

<p>
An expert knows <i>when to call bullshit</i>, what will cause problems and what
will not work at all. An expert could compare paradigms and related
methodologies, and know which techniques are effective and which are
just memes.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that by that time one is usually quite an old man, spent
and burned out so many times, that this hard-earned expert knowledge is rather a
burden. Think of a 50 years old Mike Tyson. He is definitely an expert, but&#x2026;
