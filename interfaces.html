    </header>
    <p>While <i>abstraction</i> (meaning abstracting out irrelevant
    details, not abstract philosophical or artistic bullshit) is
    the main principle of all programming (and math), what we call
    <i>Interfaces</i> is <i>the</i> most important <i>concept</i>
    in programming, period.</p>
    <p>The <i>Modularity principle</i>, just naturally follows from
    what interfaces are and how they being used.</p>
    <p><i>Domain Specific Languages</i> or DSLs, which is, perhaps,
    the second most important concept in all programming, are just
    specially designed <i>sets of functions</i> (or, more precisely
    - <i>function type-signatures</i>). But a set function
    type-signatures is what an <i>interface</i> is.</p>
    <p>Just remember, that a function is the smallest building
    block <i>of abstraction</i>, and corresponds to a single
    <i>named expression</i>, parameterized (tables) or not
    (constants). In the old times they used to call it a
    <i>procedure abstraction</i>.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the best current metaphor for interfaces is from the
    golden age of Personal Computers, when on could buy, lets say a
    video card, and just plug it into some PCI (nowadays -
    PCI-Express) slot and it will just work. Then one might change
    not just a vendor, but a whole architercure of a video card
    (let’s say from Nvidia to AMD), plug it into the motherboard,
    and everything will magically work.</p>
    <p>This is exactly what we want - the ability to swap not just
    implementation, without breaking anything, but to switch
    between “storages” or “network protocols”, having them as
    <i>plug-ins</i> (which is just a <i>module</i> that
    <i>implements some standard interface</i>).</p>

        <p><i>To be an X is to exhibit X’s /behavior</i> or just
        act exactly as X does. <i>What walks like a duck and quacks
        like duck</i>, they say. And, indeed, what can be a junior
        Javascript coder? What writes code like a javascript coder
        and quacks like a javascript coder. Anyway.</p>

      <h3 id="orga0e58ad">Biology</h3>
      <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga0e58ad">
        <p>This is actually a <i>universal principle</i>. You can
        “plug” or “use” any molecule, lets say a glucose, which has
        a <i>particular shape</i> (and resulting electro-chemical
        characteristics).</p>
        <p>A <i>shape</i> serves as its own <i>type</i> and all the
        individual molecules of the same shape are
        indistinguishable and interexchageable. This, by the way,
        is <i>how</i> any molecular biology or life itself is
        possible. Mother nature does not have the concept of
        “identity”.</p>
        <p>There could be molecules which has exactly the same
        “parts” or “sides”, and these parts can be used <i>as if
        the molecules are exactly the same</i>. Biology uses this
        trick all the time.</p>
        <p>That particular “shape” or arrangement which triggers
        some <i>enzymes</i> or binds to some <i>receptors</i> is,
        operationally, <i>an interface</i>. It is that
        fundamental.</p>

      <h2 id="org927e77c">The essence</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org927e77c">
        <p>The essence of programming is to reduce everything to
        the few <i>universal principles</i> and universal
        <i>building blocks</i> which found in biology (after
        enumerable trials-and-errors). Smart people call them
        “stable intermediate building blocks”.</p>
        <p>It turns out that <i>hierarchical (or layered) DSLs</i>
        is a universal architecture. But DSLs are just specialized
        interfaces.</p>
        <p>Just make them <i>pure-functional</i>, like the
        imaginary core of molecular biology (enzymes are pure
        functions, and molecular structures are, at least
        operationally, <i>immutable and persistent</i>, if you
        don’t know. Yes, DNA and RNA occasionally breaks, and DNA
        some times can be repaired, but they are not “supposed to”
        ).</p>
        <p>Even better - is to use the mind of an external observer
        <i>to generalize and derive useful abstractions</i> (like a
        Number or a linear sequence, a tree or a lookup table) and
        use the minimal possible set of these abstractions to
        <i>represent</i> and <i>define</i> your problem domain.
        This is what the Set Theory and the First Order Logic do in
        math (which happen to be DSLs embedded in it).</p>
        <p>And the essence of the essence is to use a
        <i>minimal</i> arrangement that is <i>stable</i>, just does
        <i>one</i> thing and <i>does it well</i>. And build whole
        <i>hierarchies</i> out of these arrangements. Yes, you have
        probably heard this somewhere before.</p>
