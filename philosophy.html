    <p>The only question of a proper philosophy, since the times of
    the earliest <i>Upanishads</i> is <i>What Is Real?</i> or -
    discarding some redundancy - <i>What Is?</i>.</p>
    <p>The biggest achievement of the ancient Eastern philosophy,
    which is philosophy of the mind, was postulating the principle
    of primacy of “Reality” - that <i>it comes before the mind</i>
    (and everything living) and <i>reduction of everything</i> to
    that “Real”, defining everything as different aspects of the
    One.</p>
    <p>Nowadays we would call it localized <i>sub-processes</i> of
    the single one Universe, which itself is a one single
    process.</p>
    <p>The notions of a <i>process</i> and of a physical
    <i>locality</i> are the most fundamental and everything else
    could be derived from these.</p>
    <p>A cell, localized in its particular environment (subject to
    a set particular physical constraints) is a process, which has
    distinct boundaries - a membrane which is required for a
    process to sustain itself.</p>
    <p>Every process has its own locality and physical boundaries
    (which separate it from the rest of the Universe), and this,
    again, is a fundamental, universal notion (a universal
    pattern).</p>
    <p>It is not arbitrary or due to a chance that what we call
    “fundamental laws of physics” are based on the notion of an
    <i>inverse square of distance</i>.</p>
    <p>The notion of a <i>distance</i> thus is the basis of the
    notion of being <i>unrelated</i>, which is operationally means
    <i>“too distant to have any effect”</i>.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, everything in Universe is related and unfolds
    due to the <i>Causality Principle</i>, and this realization
    goes back to <i>Upanishads</i>.</p>
    <p>The Causality Principle itself is beautifully captured with
    the famous <i>Modus Ponens</i>, which states that “when what is
    <i>necessary and sufficient</i> is present (in a given
    locality) <i>and</i> <i>the process</i> is here (in the same
    locality), then the results will follow inevitably”.</p>
    <p>No wonder that expressed symbolically with an <i>evolved
    notation</i>.</p>

    <p>it corresponds to (or actually <i>is</i>) an application of
    a function to an argument, which is a <i>captured universal
    notion of a single step of a process</i>.</p>
    <p>Everything is related and consistent, as it indeed must
    be.</p>
    <p>The Hilbert system of logic, in which there is only one rule
    - this <i>Modus Ponens</i> - is not a coincidence, it is the
    only way.</p>
    <p>Not surprisingly, what we call a <i>pipeline</i> is just an
    <i>application</i> with arguments reversed.</p>
    <div class="org-src-container">
      <pre class="src src-haskell"><span style=
      "color: #81A1C1;">(</span><span style=
      "color: #88C0D0;">|&gt;</span><span style=
      "color: #81A1C1;">)</span> <span style=
      "color: #D8DEE9;">::</span> a <span style=
      "color: #D8DEE9;">-&gt;</span> <span style=
      "color: #81A1C1;">(</span>a <span style=

</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Still the same <i>Modus Ponens</i>.</p>
    <p>In <i>Lambda Calculus</i> an application is so fundamental
    that it is almost overlooked, while it is the only way to take
    <i>a single step of computation</i>.</p>
    <p>The other fundamental notion, also overlooked, is of
    <i>nesiting</i> which is the only way to establish an order of
    evaluation in <i>Lambda Calculus</i>.</p>
    <p>And, of course, <i>partitioning, application</i> and
    <i>nesting</i> have corresponding <i>universal notions</i>
    (which they are capture).</p>
    <p>Again, nothing is arbitrary here. The mind of an external
    observer captures actual patterns and evolve corresponding
    symbolic notations and formalized notions.</p>
