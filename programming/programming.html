<h2 id="org39a2aaa">Just write everything down</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org39a2aaa">
<p>
The main problem with programming is one being totally <i>overwhelmed</i> with
irrelevant details, especially in <i>C-like imperative languages</i>.
</p>

<p>
The solution is the classic <i>layered</i> design, with layers of <i>DSLs</i> on top
of one another. These DLSa are just functions, standardized interfaces
and protocols. This is how <i>TeX</i> (and <i>LaTeX</i>) has been written and other
remarkable things like the whole <i>X Window System</i>.
</p>

<p>
The complexity, however, is still overwhelming. The final solution is to
write everything down as informal specifications, formal specifications
and even discrete <i>math</i>.
</p>

<p>
Informal specs should written be in <i>org-mode</i>, formal specs in pure
functional languages or even specialized theorem provers such as <code>Coq</code> or
<code>Agda</code> (both have an <i>embedded</i> pure-functional language which can be used
for a quick prototyping).
</p>

<p>
Actually, the real problem is that you <i>will forget everything you have
thought</i>. So it pays to write down as much as you can.
</p>

<p>
Writing is also the best known from of transmitting a knowledge
through the time and to other people, including to an older you.
</p>

<p>
Writing itself is a very challenging and difficult task, since an
art-level clarity and brevity is required, similar to the best
mathematical texts which accompany some proofs.

<h2 id="orgff15b69">Test Driven Development</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgff15b69">
<p>
The consistent practice of writing tests before code is a <i>rare
non-bullshit advice</i> from the world of project management.
</p>

<p>
It helps you to focus on a higher-level concepts of <i>interfaces</i>
(type-signatures) and <i>modules</i> and check both the <i>use side</i> and the
<i>definition side</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>ADTs</i> and corresponding <i>modules</i> are at the very core of programming
(within every <i>paradigm</i>) so to beginning with and focus on them is indeed
a valuable <i>habit</i> to develop.
</p>

<p>
Write the tests - your &ldquo;use side&rdquo; - before an implementation, and check if
everything is in accordance with your <i>specifications</i>. This is an outline
of actual design process, insead of day-dreaming and hand-waving.

<h2 id="org8059166">Math</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8059166">
<p>
It turns out that before thinking about actual interfaces (and
type-signatures) even higher-level and mode abstract <i>mathematical
thinking</i> (and writing) is required.
</p>

<p>
The two DLSs - of The Set Theory and of the First-Order Logic - are at the
code of all modern mathematics. Other specialized &ldquo;logics&rdquo; are
occasionally useful.
</p>

<p>
<i>Always write all the relevant math down</i> (in a LaTeX subset of org-mode).
This will pay you back immensely. First, because you will forget it all
in a week. Second, because other people can check and even verify your
reasoning. This is priceless.

<h2 id="orgda1fa27">UNIX Philosophy + Functional Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgda1fa27">
<p>
It always looks simple in retrospect. Just take the best parts of the
UNIX Philosophy (do just one thing but do it well, use text streams,
files, pipes and sockets) and use <code>SML/NJ</code>, <code>Erlang</code>, <code>Haskell</code> or <code>Ocaml</code> instead of <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code>. Well, <code>SML</code> is rather a monument of the glorious times long gone, so <code>Ocaml</code> or <code>Haskell</code> but never re-implementing the wheel, and just <i>FFI&rsquo;ing everything</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you are trapped in the JVM ecosystem, then there is <code>Scala 3</code>, which doing almost everything right, except, of course, the fucking dependencines and 3 versions of the compiler and standard library in a smallest setup. Well, with <code>Haskell</code> that is even worse.
</p>

<p>
Text streams and FP maps very well with so-called <i>Micro-services architecture</i> - as long as you are <i>pure functional</i> (Same input - same output. Always.), which implies <i>referentially transparent</i>, you can really mix and match &ldquo;services&rdquo; just like a functional programmer mix and match <i>functions</i>. Yes, for real. <code>Coursier</code>, <code>Kafka</code> or <code>Twitter toolchain</code> are the actual use cases.
</p>

<p>
Just getting rid of imperative code (aliasing problems, lifetimes, locks, semaphors, etc) and verbose, boated sources is already a bliss and an unexpected return of the <i>joy of programming</i> which programmers of the Golden Age (Common Lisp, Smalltalk, Standard ML, Miranda, Haskell) used to feel. <i>Happy, happy, joy, joy</i> (this is from the MIT Scheme).
</p>

<p>
Using a <i>high level, mostly functional</i> language in UNIX instead of <code>C</code> is (unfortunately) not my idea. <i>Bell Labs</i> had a research project which resulted in development of the <i>Basis Library</i> and a couple of books. Today, it seems that <code>Ocaml</code> picked everything up where they left. Just like it was with SML, a major <i>theorem proover</i> (<code>Coq</code>) is the main project for the whole ecosystem, and it has just the <i>standard library</i> in dependencies (well, almost).
</p>

<p>
Another thing to add is what is loosely called <i>reactive programming</i> which is just <i>triggers on events from an event stream</i>. This is already a mess and a contenst in blog post idiocy, but one could use the right abstractions (which are streams and typed events to pattern-match upon). Some Haskell&rsquo;s graphics and animation libraries got it right.
</p>

<p>
Any kind of immutable databases, ledgers, etc. could <i>naturally</i> be developed using this approach. <i>Datomic</i> of Rich Hickey is an attempt for an <i>immutable store</i>. <i>XTZ</i> is a blockchain implementation in pure Ocaml, while others still got stuck with <code>C and C++</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Haskell Platform</i> (GHC + a small set of well-designed libraries) and the <i>Ocaml Ecosystem</i> (the compiler, tools and the libraries via <code>opam</code>) are <i>production-ready</i> environments. One always could enrich them with <code>Coq</code>, <code>Agda</code> and <code>TLA+</code> to reach the level of an <i>art</i> (instead of that <i>learn to code in javascript or python</i> fucking abomination).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbd47f61" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbd47f61">Algebraic types and pattern-matching</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd47f61">
<p>
Anything could be build out of <i>Algebraic Data Types</i>.
</p>

<p>
There are <i>AND-types</i> (<code>A, B</code> - product-types), <i>OR-types</i> (<code>A | B</code> - sum-types) and <i>lambda
types</i> (<code>A -&gt; B</code> - correspond to exponents).
</p>

<p>
Everything becomes self-evident when we think of types as <i>finite sets</i> and consider all the individual unique
mappings (<i>arrows</i>) between the elements of any two such sets.
</p>

<p>
We could pattern-match on <i>data-constructors</i> which conceptually are the same
as <i>type-tags</i> for every value.
</p>

<p>
Logically, we can imagine that each value has an implicit
<i>type-tag attached to it</i>. Type-tags are as old as early LISPs and this, in
turn, corresponds to unique shapes of common molecular structures in biology.
</p>

<p>
A list is a <i>recursive</i> sum-type. So are <i>trees</i>.
A record is a <i>product type</i> with <i>tagged</i> (named) values (parts).
A table is a mapping (just like a function) from &ldquo;rows&rdquo; to &ldquo;columns&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
One could think of a table as a <i>list of tuples</i> (an ordered sequence of
fixed-size &ldquo;sequences&rdquo;). The early LISPs has been built this way.

<h2 id="org7fe32c7">The Relational Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7fe32c7">
<p>
Everything &ldquo;fits together&rdquo; because conceptually, at the most abstract
level it is all just <i>sets of tuples</i>, which is the basis of <i>both</i>
Functional Languages and the Relational Model.
</p>

<p>
The crucial principle is that relations are just <i>sets of tuples</i>, and the whole
relations are <i>immutable values</i>, with all the usual nice properties and implications.
</p>

<p>
Everything is &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; <i>typed</i> with Algebraic Data Types - a record is just a
&ldquo;named&rdquo; tuple, which, in turn, is a <i>product-type</i>. <i>Sum-types</i> provide all
the required enumerables.
</p>

<p>
There is a simple and obvious <i>relation algebra</i> based on the algebra of
the Set Theory, with the <i>closure property</i>.
</p>

<p>
Like any other values, these <i>relation</i> values can be passed to and
returned from pure <i>functions</i>, used within <i>persistent aggregates</i>, put
into immutable <i>trees</i>, etc.
</p>

<p>
This maps well to <i>persistent data structures</i> (trees and maps) of functional languages.
</p>

<p>
Lists of records (&ldquo;named&rdquo; tuples) where the actual ordering is
irrelevant (unless deliberately <i>sorted</i>) is an obvious transition from
the abstract universe of Sets to the concrete reality of actual
representations and languages.

As long as we are able to model and formally specify our domain in the <i>language of

Logic and could derive a simple <i>domain-specific /algebra</i>, the
complexity is under our control.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb9b816c">
<p>
This is the most important thing in managing complexity - the ability to
zoom in from a mathematical model to actual language types and
implementations inside modules and back to the most general and abstract
notions.
</p>

<p>
This ability is the key to success and the biginning of an art.&rsquo;

<p>
The modern descendants of the ML-family of languages are an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;
choice.
</p>

<p>
Haskell is particularly good, because it <i>restricts</i> and has the most
advanced <i>type system</i>.
</p>

<p>
Ocaml shines with its <i>module system</i> and <i>syntactic extensions</i>.

Scala 3 is also good, given that we use our own <i>simple</i> libraries (made

<h2 id="orgf0d8e13">Building blocks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf0d8e13">
<p>
There are basically 3 things that could happen with two (one more than one) <i>values</i> (or whole
sets, or <i>types</i>)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>a, b</code> (which corresponds logical <i>AND also</i>, a <i>product</i>)</li>
<li><code>a | b</code> (which corresponds logical <i>OR else</i>, a <i>disjoint union</i>)</li>
<li><code>a -&gt; b</code> (which corresponds to a logical <i>implication</i> or to a single STEP
of computation (or evaluation of an expression), which can be
abstracted out as a <i>function</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p>
This, by the way, is when we <i>transform</i> values into the same type or into
another <i>of the same kind</i>. What if we transform them into something completely
different?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>a -&gt; f b</code> - this is &ldquo;putting into&rdquo; or &ldquo;sending&rdquo; (no way to get back)</li>
<li><code>f a -&gt; a</code> - this is &ldquo;tacking from&rdquo; or &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; (no way to put it
there)
These are <i>duals</i> of each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One could think of <code>a -&gt; f b</code> as <i>extending an immutable structure</i>, and,
conversely, <code>f a -&gt; a</code> as <i>traversing an immutable structure</i>
</p>

<p>
Notice that with the first two arrangements the <i>order is irrelevant</i> and
the two <i>views are isomorphic</i>, while the third relation is <i>directed</i> and <code>b
-&gt; a</code> is not the same, but there could be a such <i>inverse function</i> (or
operation) within a particular context.
</p>

<p>
Adding the universal notion of <i>nesting</i> we could have <i>infinite lists</i>
(which is a <i>recursive structure</i> or a <i>nested type</i> - a sum of a product).

<div id="outline-container-orgd282258" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd282258">Monads</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd282258">
<p>
A <i>Monad</i> (as an <i>Abstract Data Type</i>) has to form an algebraic structure
called <i>Monoid</i> with respect to its operations (defined as a standardized
<i>interface</i> - <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> (composition) and <code>return</code>).
</p>

<p>
This <i>interface</i>, which has to form an instance of a <i>Monoid</i>  with respect
to the <i>binary operator</i> <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, is a generalized <i>abstraction barrier</i> for <i>composable entities</i>, or <i>values of a particular
type</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is defined as a <i>type-class</i>, implying that any <i>particular type
(an ADT) which implements the interface</i> (and ensures Monoidal laws -
<i>associativity and identity properties</i>) becomes an <i>instance of a Monad</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now there is the trick. Behind this generalized <i>abstraction barrier</i> (of
composable values) could be a value of a <i>sum-type</i>, of a <i>product-type</i>, of a <i>function-type</i> or
<i>any nested combinations of these</i>. So there are different kinds of
Monads.
</p>

<p>
Or, <i>operationally</i>, once we can implement the minimal interface (<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> and
<code>return</code>) for a given ADT, it <i>becomes</i> an instance of a Monad. <i>To be an
instance of a /Monad /is to (also) implement the interface</i>.
</p>

<p>
A <code>List</code> is a such particular instance, where <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> corresponds to <code>append</code>, and the <code>[]</code> is
an <i>identity element</i>.
</p>

<p>
A <i>parameterized sum-type</i> behind this <i>abstraction barrier</i> is a common
idiom.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>promises and other kids of <i>asynchronous operations</i></li>
<li>computations which <i>may fail</i> in general</li>
<li>values which could be <i>empty</i> or <i>contain nothing</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
or even an <i>arbitrary sum-type</i> (an <code>a | b</code>) could be made into an
instance of a Monad, which means <i>the ADT</i> forms a Monoid with respect to some
<i>associative composition operator abstracted out as</i> <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.
</p>

<p>
Notice this very careful wording.
</p>

<p>
In decent languages the static type system <i>guarantees</i> that this
abstraction barrier <i>cannot be violated at runtime</i>.
</p>

<p>
Additional type-system tricks, such as use of so-called <i>existential types</i> with
<i>phantom parameters</i> makes a <i>type-level guarantee</i> that a value <i>cannot
escape from a given context</i> or simply cannot be accessed <i>in principle</i>.
