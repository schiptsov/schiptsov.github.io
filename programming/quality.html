<h1 class="title">Quality and craftsmanship</h1>
</header><p>
High quality programs are such that are reliable <i>and also</i> reasonably
easy to understand, modify, and maintain.
</p>

<p>
Ease of understanding does not only imply <i>readability</i>, which in turn
implies composition of small functions from small, specialized modules,
but also an adequate mappings (arrows, literarally) from the major
concepts of the problem domain to corresponding <i>algebraic types</i> (<i>records</i>
and <i>tagged disjoint unions</i>).
</p>

<p>
Proper structuring of the code contributes to more convenient
modification and maintenance, but the main tool is an advanced type
system which assist in catching dumb errors, typos and saves a lot of
time in general.
</p>

<p>
Defining functions by universal (which means function clauses and <i>every
binding</i> in general) <i>pattern-matching</i> goes even beyond a type-system, by
providing means of talking about <i>shapes of the type-tagged values</i>, where
<i>data-constructors</i> correspond to type-tags.
</p>

<p>
Having just these techniques alone provides a potential <i>order of
magnitude</i> improvements in overal code quality over verbose, crappy
imperative languages.
</p>

<p>
The classic study in which Haskell code tends to be <i>10x
shorter</i> on average is well-known, and similar findings come from the
Erlang world. I can bet my reputation that Ocaml projects (Jane Street
or Tezos) have the same properties.
</p>

<p>
John Carmack, who advocates obsession with quality, never settling with
anything less than doing your absolute best, and hard work (he is
indeed Mike Tyson of <i>imperative</i> programming), would&rsquo;ve benefited greatly
if it was possible for him to use really well-researched and just decent
languages.
</p>

<p>
But, fortunately, we are not hardcore game-devs, so we can easily escape
the abomination of <code>C++</code> or rigid idiocy of <code>Java</code> and OOP mass-hysteria in
general - no, not everything should be an object and to have a unique
<i>id</i>, while <i>uniformity</i>, as in Smalltalk, is, of course, the right,
universal principle.
</p>

<p>
(Mentioning javascript is the same disgrace and low taste as mentioning porn or PHP).
</p>

<p>
So, quality <i>begins</i> with decent high-level <i>pure- or mostly-functional</i>
languages of the <code>ML</code> family, which in turn, are descendants of early
Lisps (at least conceptually and semantically).
