<h1 class="title">Interfaces</h1>
</header><p>
While <i>abstraction</i> (meaning abstracting out irrelevant details, not
abstract philosophical or artistic bullshit) is the main principle of
all programming (and math), what we call <i>Interfaces</i> is <i>the</i> most important <i>concept</i> in programming,
period.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Modularity principle</i>, just naturally follows from what
interfaces are and how they being used.
</p>

<p>
<i>Domain Specific Languages</i> or DSLs, which is, perhaps, the second most
important concept in all programming, are just specially designed <i>sets
of functions</i> (or, more precisely - <i>function type-signatures</i>). But a set
function type-signatures is what an <i>interface</i> is.
</p>

<p>
Just remember, that a function is the smallest building block <i>of abstraction</i>,
and corresponds to a single <i>named expression</i>, parameterized (tables) or not
(constants). In the old times they used to call it a <i>procedure abstraction</i>.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best current metaphor for interfaces is from the golden age
of Personal Computers, when on could buy, lets say a video card, and
just plug it into some PCI (nowadays - PCI-Express) slot and it will
just work. Then one might change not just a vendor, but a whole
architercure of a video card (let&rsquo;s say from Nvidia to AMD), plug it
into the motherboard, and everything will magically work.
</p>

<p>
This is exactly what we want - the ability to swap not just
implementation, without breaking anything, but to switch between
&ldquo;storages&rdquo; or &ldquo;network protocols&rdquo;, having them as <i>plug-ins</i> (which is
just a <i>module</i> that <i>implements some standard interface</i>).

<i>To be an X is to exhibit X&rsquo;s /behavior</i> or just act exactly as X does.
<i>What walks like a duck and quacks like duck</i>, they say. And, indeed, what
can be a junior Javascript coder? What writes code like a javascript
coder and quacks like a javascript coder. Anyway.

<p>
This is actually a <i>universal principle</i>. You can &ldquo;plug&rdquo; or &ldquo;use&rdquo; any molecule, lets say a glucose, which has a
<i>particular shape</i> (and resulting electro-chemical characteristics).
</p>

<p>
A <i>shape</i> serves as its own <i>type</i> and all the individual molecules of the
same shape are indistinguishable and interexchageable. This, by the way,
is <i>how</i> any molecular biology or life itself is possible. Mother nature
does not have the concept of &ldquo;identity&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
There could be molecules which has exactly the same &ldquo;parts&rdquo; or
&ldquo;sides&rdquo;, and these parts can be used <i>as if the molecules are exactly the
same</i>. Biology uses this trick all the time.
</p>

<p>
That particular &ldquo;shape&rdquo; or arrangement which triggers some <i>enzymes</i> or
binds to some <i>receptors</i> is, operationally, <i>an interface</i>. It is that
fundamental.

<h2 id="org10a37e2">The essence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org10a37e2">
<p>
The essence of programming is to reduce everything to the few <i>universal
principles</i> and universal <i>building blocks</i> which found in biology (after
enumerable trials-and-errors). Smart people call them &ldquo;stable
intermediate building blocks&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that <i>hierarchical (or layered) DSLs</i> is a universal
architecture. Just like <i>the language</i> of the Set Theory has been embedded
into mathematics, an <i>Abstract Data Type</i> that implements the Set
abstraction - the <i>module</i> - extends a pure functional language like Haskell (or the pure subset
of Ocaml).
</p>

<p>
Mathematicians never consider <i>representation</i> or even <i>existence</i> (leave
alone <i>implementation</i>) of their &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, and the actual technique (and
a whole methodology) of using <i>Abstract Data Types</i>, which create an
<i>abstraction barrier</i> and hide implementation details behind (which could even be
swapped - one <i>module</i> for another) is what Barbara Liskov got her Turing
Award for.
</p>

<p>
DSLs are just specialized <i>abstract interfaces</i> and a
corresponding <i>module</i> which abstracts out the actual implementation behind its
<i>abstract public interface</i>. Exactly like a module which implements Sets.
</p>

<p>
Just make them <i>pure-functional</i>, like the imaginary core of molecular biology (enzymes are pure
functions, and molecular structures are, at least operationally,
<i>immutable and persistent</i>, if you don&rsquo;t know. Yes, DNA and RNA
occasionally breaks, and DNA some times can be repaired, but they are not &ldquo;supposed to&rdquo; ).
</p>

<p>
Even better - is to use the mind of an external observer <i>to generalize
and derive useful abstractions</i> (like a Number or a linear sequence, a tree or a lookup table) and use the
minimal possible set of these abstractions to <i>represent</i> and <i>define</i> your
problem domain. This is what the Set Theory and the First Order Logic do
in math (which happen to be DSLs embedded in it).
</p>

<p>
And the essence of the essence is to use a <i>minimal</i> arrangement that is
<i>stable</i>, just does <i>one</i> thing and <i>does it well</i>. And build whole
<i>hierarchies</i> out of these arrangements. Yes, you have probably
heard this somewhere before.
