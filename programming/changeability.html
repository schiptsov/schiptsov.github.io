Source code is (and should be) one of the most malleable medium of
expression (it is a <i>structured text</i>, and it has much more structure than a novel or a poem).
</p>

<p>
Unlike a paining, which is difficult or even impossible to change
after a certain point (it will be easier and reasonable to start from
scratch), changing a structured text in a file is a much easier
operation, especially when each function or an expression is <i>loosely
coupled</i> or even <i>completely orthogonal</i> to most of others (except in the
<i>call-graph</i>, of course).
</p>

<p>
With this property of our medium of expression, changes must be easy and
cheap (we must <i>invest a lot of effort and optimize heavily for changeability</i>) given that, unlike an article, a novel, a poem or a painting, a program is never finished, never completed.
</p>

<p>
A program has to continuously <i>co-evolve</i> along with our knowledge and
understanding of the problem domain, which is also never completed. The
journey never ends, as they said.
</p>

<p>
So, all the best available methodologies, techniques and tools, which
<i>facilitate changes and made them easy and painless</i>, must be used.
</p>

<p>
The mantra is <i>Pure-functional. Well-typed. Immutable and Persistent</i>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>embracing changes means embracing <i>data immutability</i>.</li>
<li>use small, <i>pure functions</i> (the procedure abstraction)</li>
<li>abstract out repeated code into small functions (no duplication)</li>
<li>an <i>advanced static type system</i> (much easier refactoring, less errors)</li>
<li>use <i>small modules for every ADT</i> (the data abstraction principle)</li>
<li><i>formally specify</i> every single function and interface (write specs)</li>
<li>rely heavily on <i>executable specification</i> and testing tools</li>
<li>use <i>persistent data structure</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, changing means adding new pieces to what already is there.
Persistent data is the key to manage changes (and related complexity).
</p>

<p>
These notions are universal (being <i>rediscovered again and again</i>).
Very different, even completely independent groups of researchers have
arrived at the same set of fundamental principles (largely due to
underlying mathematics and understanding of <i>how the mind works</i>).
</p>

<p>
Mathematics, however, does not exist in a vacuum of the sterile universe
of pure abstract ideas, and is a product of the mind of &ldquo;external
observers&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The core of mathematics is grounded in &ldquo;What Is&rdquo;, and consists of
generalized and abstracted out notions, derived from
observations of recurrent processes of the Universe and of emerging from
apparent &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; relations, patterns, symmetries.
</p>

<p>
The best programmers, by the way, are not pure mathematicians (they
mess everything op with incorporating too much of abstract nonsense),
but <i>molecular biologists</i>, who have at least some ideas of how Life
Itself works and <i>why</i>.
</p>

<p>
Definitely the best system designers have at least some background in
biology.
