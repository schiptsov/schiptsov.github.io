Back in the old glorious times of the <i>golden age</i>, some Lisp guys have re-discovered this <i>universal idea</i>.
Every <i>expression</i> (which implicitly has a type) can be rendered into a unique &ldquo;printable
form&rdquo; (to be printed by the REPL).
</p>

<p>
Eventually they have arrived at an <i>invariant</i>, that the unique &ldquo;printable form&rdquo; has to be the
same as a corresponding &ldquo;readable form&rdquo; (the one a REPL can <i>read in</i>).
</p>

<p>
Remember that in a proper LISP every expression is not a plain text but
an actual nested structure made out of <code>cons</code>-es, and it goes through the <code>read</code> function which
converts <i>nested lists</i> into <i>particular data and syntactic forms</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is the basics for LISP&rsquo;s unique and rich <i>macros</i> - <i>arbitrary</i>
syntactic forms (which <code>eval</code> never seen before but would &ldquo;understand&rdquo;)
can be generated by <i>turning the <code>read</code> function on and off</i> at certain parts of an
<i>expression</i> (a list-structure).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, a complex <i>nested</i> expression can thus be printed (and read in) just by
simple <i>traversal</i>, and the whole &ldquo;printable and REPL-readable
representation&rdquo; became the source and an inspiration for SGML and HTML
standards, and for the latter notion of  &ldquo;on-the-wire&rdquo; data
representation - a whole <i>compound, deeply nested immutable value</i> is just &ldquo;right there&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental principle, however, is in that the concept of a &ldquo;number 42&rdquo; can
be represented (written down on a piece of paper) as just <code>42</code> and every occurrence of these written symbols
can be &ldquo;read back&rdquo; (into the mind) as a whole number.
</p>

<p>
This is not just a traditional convention, it reflects on the fact that every <code>H2O</code> molecule is the same
as every other, and this holds for all simple molecules of the same
kind, which are Life&rsquo;s &ldquo;stable&rdquo; building blocks.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays all decent mostly-functional languages support this facility,
along with libraries for converting between different <i>human- or
machine-readable representations</i> of the data.
</p>

<p>
Haskell&rsquo;s <code>deriving (Show, Read)</code> is, obviously, the culmination of what
LISP guys have discovered.
</p>

<p>
Just remember that <i>data formats matter, and that all data must be /immutable</i>.
