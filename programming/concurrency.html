Immutability and the  <i>data-centric approach</i> &#x2013;  &ldquo;whole&rdquo; structured
values &ldquo;on the wire&rdquo; instead of calling methods on objects &#x2013; solves most
of the problems.
</p>

<p>
This includes propagation of &ldquo;errors&rdquo;, and a monad is a good fit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Failures&rdquo; or &ldquo;Errors&rdquo; must be modeled explicitly as a part of the
domain model. They are just &ldquo;<i>backtracting</i>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The authors of Erlang have everything solved in principle. We just take
advantage of better-designed languages of the ML-family.
</p>

<p>
The <i>multi-threaded imperative OO crap</i> is fucked beyond repair. They piled up
on the wrong (faulty) principles.
</p>

<p>
Immutability is not an academic fancy, it is a universal principle, which
makes Life Itself possible (every molecule of the same kind is as good
as every other, and they are being <i>passing around</i> freely).

<h2 id="orgfd9ffaf">Concurrency vs. Parallelism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd9ffaf">
<p>
<i>Concurrency</i> means some sort of <i>time-sharing /scheduling</i> or <i>cooperative multitasking</i> by
some &ldquo;supervisor&rdquo; process.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sharing</i> (of the call stack, for example) means they cannot run <i>simultaneously</i>
in principle.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parallelism</i> implies <i>share-nothing</i> processes (total <i>closures</i>), running on the same
hardware or on different nodes.
</p>

<p>
Really smart people &#x2013; the developers of Erlang &#x2013; solved everything back
then by postulating that <i>share-nothing processes</i> which can perform <i>asynchronous
message-passing</i> is the only viable solution. It is even better when the
code is pure functional.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org01dbc1b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org01dbc1b">Asynchronous vs. Synchronous</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org01dbc1b">
<p>
A normal function (or a chain of deeply <i>nested</i> functions) has to <i>return</i>.
</p>

<p>
A compiler usually <i>inlines</i> nested (or composed) function into one big
block of code which has an entry point and en exit point.
</p>

<p>
If a &ldquo;function&rdquo; is annotated as <i>asynchronous</i>, it means that it is
<i>wrapped</i> in some &ldquo;execution context&rdquo; or a <i>light-wright process</i> (which
usually shares everything except code in memory) of its own.
</p>

<p>
This means that it is not a <i>simple sequential</i> (graph reduction) process
anymore.
</p>

<p>
To such asynchronous processes (or &ldquo;execution contexts&rdquo;) some additional
<i>signaling of completion</i> is <i>always</i> required via some &ldquo;external&rdquo; mechanism
(runtime-support).
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgaedae36" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgaedae36">More than one</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaedae36">
<p>
This is not merely pure function composition (via nesting). Having more
than one &ldquo;thread&rdquo; (or a routine) of execution <i>implies /coordination</i> and
<i>communication</i> of some kind by runtime.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6475777" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6475777">Message passing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6475777">
<p>
The right thing to do is what Erlang did - spawn a process, get its
&ldquo;address&rdquo;, and send it a message. It will eventually send you &ldquo;the
result&rdquo; back in a message (result will be delivered to your &ldquo;mailbox&rdquo;).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6023e2b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6023e2b">Callbacks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6023e2b">
<p>
The most straightforward solution is to pass an additional parameter to
the asynchronous &ldquo;function&rdquo; (an explicit callback) which will be callled instead of just
returning.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the callback (or a whole chain of them) <i>has to return</i>
eventually. Because it is the <i>tail-call</i> it could be optimized nicely
using the standard TCO.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1459f40" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1459f40">Concurrent futures</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1459f40">
<p>
Futures do <i>not</i> signal completion but they can be called (polled) more than
once.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, they can be <i>created or dispatched</i> (and some callable <i>reference</i> is
returned) and then <i>called</i> one or more time.
</p>

<p>
When future is <i>not ready</i> it just blocks the caller.
</p>

<p>
Notice that every future is still a <i>separate sub-process with sharing</i>,
so what appears as a normal <i>function call</i> is really a <i>coordination</i> and <i>communication</i> at
runtime.
</p>

<p>
Futures are similar to what OS <code>poll</code> or <code>select</code> calls do.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgee693b9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgee693b9">Non-blocking vs. Blocking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgee693b9">
<p>
The only way to achieve &ldquo;non-blocking&rdquo; is to have multiple &ldquo;execution
contexts&rdquo;. There is no other way in principle.
</p>

<p>
Non-blocking code just spawns (starts) more &ldquo;processes or routines&rdquo; (or
sends messages to do so) and continues. This is exactly what
&ldquo;delegation&rdquo; or &ldquo;dispatching&rdquo; is.
</p>

<p>
This, again, requires some <i>signalling of completion</i> or use of concurrent
futures.
</p>

<p>
A newly created future can me <i>send</i> (via some channel) or passed to
another async function as a parameter, and then &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Forgetting</i>&rdquo; is the part of non-blocking again. in principle.

<h2 id="orgb289959">Problems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb289959">
<p>
In pure a functional setting most problems <i>do not arise</i>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Immutability</i> solves the <i>sharing</i> and <i>concurrent execution</i> problems.</li>
<li><i>Implicit passing along of a /context</i> solves the <i>state</i> problem.</li>
<li>Sending structured data (messages) through the &ldquo;wire&rdquo; (a queue) instead of doing</li>
</ul>
<p>
method calls and returns solves the <i>communication</i> problems.
</p>

<p>
Imperative OO crap, however, is fundamentally broken beyond repair.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the shared call stack (between threads) is a problem (fundamental)</li>
<li>multi-threading access for <i>statefull objects</i> is a problem (fundamental)</li>
<li>internal state and invariants <i>cannot be guaranteed</i> in imperative
&ldquo;objects&rdquo; with a concurrent <i>execution</i></li>
<li>there is also an I/O</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org0db3ae8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0db3ae8">Summary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0db3ae8">
<p>
To summarize, any form of <i>concurrency</i> requires multiple <i>execution context</i> (coroutines,
fibers, threads, whatever) and <i>coordination and communication</i> between
there by the language runtime.
</p>

<p>
This, in turn, results in some <i>time-sharing</i> scheduling or cooperative (<i>interleaving</i>)
multitasking, which is hard and should be done by an OS with
share-nothing guarantees. Erlang authors have researched this.
</p>

<p>
The only thing we can do is to rely on some &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; (LOL) runtime,
which is experimentally shown that it is &ldquo;stable&rdquo;. - JVM, DotNET, Go, etc.
</p>

<p>
All these, however, being over-&ldquo;engineered&rdquo; imperative OO crap (except
Go), are necessarily buggy and error-prone. They <b>will</b> fail eventually.
</p>

<p>
Erlang is an exception.

<div id="outline-container-orgccf1e37" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgccf1e37">Imperative calls and returns</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgccf1e37">
<p>
Again, asynchronity means starting another processes and delegating to them.
</p>

<p>
This cannot be a simple method/function call because calls are strictly
 local to the thread.
</p>

<p>
This implies use of some shared <i>mutable</i> memory location, and some
 &ldquo;external&rdquo; (hidden) <i>event-loop</i>.
</p>

<p>
This how the caller function &ldquo;forgets&rdquo; and moves on.
</p>

<p>
Now we need to solve notification issues and separate error signaling
issues.
</p>

<p>
In the functional world we just use <i>sum-types</i> for error propagation and
message-passing for signalling. Not even callbacks.
