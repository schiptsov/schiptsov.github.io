<i>“Data dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.”</i>
— <b>Rob Pike</b>
</p>

<p>
This quote summarizes it almost perfectly. There are some of the facts, which it captures.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <i>shape</i> of the functions defined by <i>pattern-matching</i> have exactly the shape of the corresponding <i>sum-type</i> type.</li>
<li>Erlang&rsquo;s <i>pattern-matching on receive</i> does de-structuring</li>
<li><i>selectors</i> of <i>record-types</i> are <i>partial functions</i>.</li>
<li><i>in-wire</i> representation of structuted data (Erlang, Clojure).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The fundamental principle is increase the level of abstractions (interfaces) to the
highest possible level, while maintaining a layered structure of
underlying  DSLs.
</p>

<p>
To put it simple, one has to wrap types and functions <i>over</i> verbose
low-level crappy imperative code (everything will be <i>inlined</i> anyway).
</p>

<p>
The data-abstraction principle and modularity helps.
</p>

<p>
One has to use high-level features of the language <i>to mimic</i> Algebraic
Types and other features of really good languages.
</p>

<p>
A decent language <i>must</i> support generalized <i>sum-types</i> as a &ldquo;first class
citizens&rdquo; or even GADTs.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rust at least has <i>pattern-matching on Enums</i>.</li>
<li>Scala has a generalized pattern-matching.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The main problem with the languages of C-family is that low-level
imperative constructs are mixed with high-level types (classes) and operations on
them. This is exactly how Java, C++ and Rust look like.
</p>

<p>
But it does not have to be this way. Smart people bootstrap crude DSLs
out of high-order functions and use them to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; about business logic
and a problem domain.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing is to have clear <i>layers</i> with separate the
&ldquo;levels&rdquo; - a vertical <i>partitioning</i> of the concepts.
</p>

<p>
The major &ldquo;code smell&rdquo; (or even stink) is when low level imperative
stuff of handling memory or concurrency issues is presented in the code
that handles business logic. There should be only <i>parts of your DSL</i>,
which are appropriate to this particualar level of abstraction.
</p>

<p>
So, wrap <i>high-level interfaces</i> around imperative crap, design it as a
DSL, make a few <i>layers</i> if necessary, and package them into small,
specialized modules.
</p>

<p>
Use Algebraic Types (as Abstract types) as a <i>high-level</i> representations
of concepts. Hide the implementation details <i>completely</i> behind
<i>abstraction barriers</i> (ADTs).
</p>

<p>
This is exactly what <code>Scala 3</code> did to Java - it <i>wrapped better abstractions around</i>
its imperative ugliness and plain stupidity.
</p>

<p>
<i>“I tend to “grow” programs rather than think them out completely before writing them.
This way I don’t tend to make large mistakes before I discover that things have gone
wrong. Above all, it’s fun, I get immediate feedback, and I see whether my ideas work
as soon as I have typed in the program.”</i>
— <b>Joe Armstrong</b>

<h2 id="org4c4a65e">Formalize with Algebraic types</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4c4a65e">
<p>
Sets and a Second Order Logic is enough for formally define everything.
</p>

<p>
However, <i>Algebraic Types</i>, have an <i>additional structure</i>, besides being <i>sets
of arrows</i>.
</p>

<p>
One should formalize and gradually buuld a prototype with ADTs and pure
functions. This is better than pure math.
</p>

<p>
ADTs and related DSLs is the way. Things like <code>scalatest</code> is the highest level of
an art. (Programming is still an art, similar to writing a poetry).

<h2 id="orga3ad9eb">High-level, concise DSLs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga3ad9eb">
<p>
This is serious. Once one have a proper set of features which are <i>orthogonal to but
complement each other</i> (currying, partial application, implicit parameters,
traits) one gets the ability do define <i>embedded DSLs</i> as libraries or implement
libraries as <i>layers of embedded DSLs</i>.
</p>

<p>
Just look at what <code>Scalatest</code> is. It is amazing, wonderful, awesome. <i>This</i> is how
to program.
</p>

<p>
<code>akka.http.scaladsl.*</code> is another example.

<h2 id="orgb725248">Sets and Logic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb725248">
<p>
There are evolved formalisms (mental techniques <i>of an external Observer</i>). Neither exists outside ones head.
</p>

<p>
However, almost everything that can be obveserved can be <i>modeled (of formally defined)</i> with Sets and Second Order Logics.
</p>

<p>
This fact is the essence of <i>the Curry-Howard isomorphism</i>, which means that <i>proper observations eventyally converge to &ldquo;What Is&rdquo;</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is not a coincedence that we use <i>types</i> (as sets of values) in both the Lambda Calculus and a formal logic (the Narual Deduction system).
</p>

<p>
Sets <i>partition</i> the universe (of concepts) and this is a fundamental notion, which intelligent observers <i>captured</i> and <i>generalized</i>.
</p>

<p>
Different kinds of atoms and molecules, from an external observer&rsquo;s point of view, form a distinct partititons, which he call &ldquo;classes&rdquo;.

<div id="outline-container-org9d55602" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9d55602">Common idioms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9d55602">
<p>
There are common or even universal idioms in programming. Thet go back to early LISPs and CLU (which was an imperative OO language).
</p>

<p>
It is important to realize that Abstract Data Types, type-classes (of Haskell) and, well, OO classes are just <i>sets of unterfaces</i> defined in diffrerent ways.
</p>

<p>
Being, at least conceptually, <i>Sets</i>, they &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; have <i>set-subset</i> relations and the <i>union</i> (which is at the essence of everything) and <i>intersection</i> operations.
</p>

<p>
What Haskell or Scala3 call a <i>type-class</i> are just <i>named sets of interfaces</i> with a <i>set-union</i> operation, defined with a different syntax.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org34480f8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org34480f8">Types as sets of values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org34480f8">
<p>
Classes, by the way, are just more structured <i>product types</i> - they allow <i>code &ldquo;slots&rdquo;</i>, not just data &ldquo;slots&rdquo;. CLOS got it right.
</p>

<p>
Just like any other <i>strucuted (or nested) types</i>, a class is a <i>template</i> for a <i>structured (or nested) value</i> of a particular kind.
</p>

<p>
Objects differ in that they have not just an internal state (just like records) but also a set of <i>methods</i> to manipulate this state and a <i>self reference</i> (to access it).
</p>

<p>
In the classic paradigm the there <i>exported</i> functions to manipulate values of a <i>ADT</i> sitting inside a corresponding modules. <i>Referencing</i> thus is explicit.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org912a890" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org912a890">Data-constructors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org912a890">
<p>
There is &ldquo;universal&rdquo; operation of producing a new value of a specific type (or a class) - to call a data-constructor, which is a function.
</p>

<p>
The common and just right syntax is to have them Capitalizes, because this reflects it relations to corresponding mental concepts.
</p>

<p>
For parameterized types we naturally would have parameterized data-constructors.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5a5fd4f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5a5fd4f">Type-Constructors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5a5fd4f">
<p>
Type-constructors are always parameterized, because they are type-level &ldquo;functions&rdquo; or &ldquo;instantiations&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Notice that type-level <i>lambdas</i> are more general concepts and implies &ldquo;arbitraty&rdquo; transoframations at the type-level.
</p>

<p>
Only Scala 3 has them so far. Haskell has <i>type-families</i> which are restricted transformations.

<h2 id="orgb56077f">Scala 3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb56077f">
<p>
<code>Scala 3</code> is a <i>crafted</i> language. The first of its own kind. SML/NJ was Haskell were
of the &ldquo;previous generation&rdquo; of artistic craftsmanship. <code>Ocaml</code> is another example.
