Recently we have been blessed with a new piece of Holy Gospel from the Creator:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2739r0.pdf">https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2739r0.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
Ignoring fundamental (different from merely theoretical - which means imaginary
only) findings is a sing of insanity or even idiocy.
</p>

<p>
We know that <i>all of</i> mathematics &ldquo;works&rdquo; as it does only due to the (<i>necessary
and sufficient</i>) <i>referential transparency</i> property, which means that what has
been <i>defined</i> (and bound) stays the same (forever), including <i>intermediate
results</i>, which too has to be proven correct (every single step) and <i>immutable</i>.
</p>

<p>
Do no have this property - do not have mathematics and its un-ambiguity and
correctness.
</p>

<p>
Joe Armstrong came up with to the same conclusion at a different level -
mutation and concurrency (arbitrary access) do not match, which, it turns out,
just the implications of the above necessity.
</p>

<p>
Even biological systems &ldquo;built on assumption&rdquo; that DNA and mRNA structures are
&ldquo;stable&rdquo; which technically means immutable.
</p>

<p>
Explicit, non-leaking abstraction barriers, &ldquo;in-wire&rdquo; values, pure functions and
state-less interfaces were the building blocks of Erlang. All this works in
hardware (and in biology, which <i>is</i> a hardware).
</p>

<p>
How can we use C++, which tries to formalize arbitrary assignments to arbitrary memory
locations, so that lowly paid people without classic education and without understanding
of the fundamental principles and idioms can program <i>fast</i> (even <i>agile</i>), without
bugs and the need of constant maintenance? I will leave this as an exercise for
the reader.
</p>

<p>
Both Erlang and Haskell guys came up with the principle of separation of pure
and impure code using sets of interfaces (whole modules). This is, of course,
not a coincidence.
</p>

<p>
In mathematics we capture (abstract out) recurring patterns, while <i>abstracting
away</i> all seemingly irrelevant details of &ldquo;physics&rdquo; (locality, distances relative
motion, etc).
</p>

<p>
We form <i>closures</i>, which are the means of &ldquo;capturing&rdquo; (the early LISP guys, being
influenced by <i>both</i> Lambda Calculus and the discovery of the structure of DNA, knew the
importance of closures).
</p>

<p>
With the set-theoretic formalism (with some parts from the Category theory) and logic
(which <i>both</i> are formalizations of different aspects of reasoning by the mind of
an External Observer - classification and of the underlying rules or &ldquo;laws&rdquo;) we can
analyze captured patterns (closures).
</p>

<p>
And this is what mathematics is all about - we capture, define and then analyze.
</p>

<p>
It all &ldquo;works&rdquo; because everything <i>captured</i> stays the same (<i>closures</i> and
resulting derivations are immutable). Losing this <i>invariant</i> will destroy
mathematics and logic (in logic previous true assertions are immutable).
</p>

<p>
Going all the way down to molecular biology -  building block are better to be
immutable (or at least stable-enough to provide all the <i>stable intermediate forms</i>).
</p>

<p>
Mathematics is based on this very principle - immutability of what is captured
and of the previous <i>proven results</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is where the second-order principles of immutable data-structures are
coming from. Once whatever you already captured change behind your back you are
fucked. Change of what has been captured is the same as destruction.
</p>

<p>
Now what are the interfaces? Well, it is, aside from being generalization of
cell membranes, is that abstraction barrier of a <i>closure</i>, which separates it
from the rest of the conceptual and linguistic bullshit.
</p>

<p>
We literally bring a <i>closure</i> into the realm of pure, rigorous, formal
thoughts and understanding - into the environment of an <i>evaluation engine</i> (the
MIT Scheme guys again).
</p>

<p>
There is a big problem, however - If we <i>capture</i> bullshit, the outcome will be
bullshit.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we miss out a single relevant factor we captured bullshit.</li>
<li>If we used an imaginary entity as real we are fucked.</li>
<li>If a relation does not exist, everything that uses it yields bullshit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
And so on. The early logic guys figured it all out long ago - the results must
be &ldquo;just right&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The early FP people came with many fundamental results, including the principle of
<i>having at most one mutable reference and passing it along</i>. Such restrictions
will preserve the referential transparency and all the properties that follow
from it.
</p>

<p>
So, the partial answer is to use the right &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; and idioms, not just
arbitrary imperative <i>destructive</i> assignments of everything to everything.
Restrictions and partitioning (and communication) are <i>universal</i> and <i>necessary</i>.
</p>

<p>
Haskell guys do it in practice (at the cost of explicitness and over-verbosity). They also do
reinforce (at a type-level) the actual abstraction barriers, which keep their
code <i>partitioned</i> and as pure as math or logic.
</p>

<p>
How about the impure computer? Well, the main function of any haskell program is
a pure declarative expression - it is a declaration of a type-safe <i>abstract
state-machine</i> to be executed by an impure runtime on a dirty imperative
computer (just as out pure math and logic is evaluated by dirty biological meat
of the brain).
</p>

<p>
Back to Stroustrup. Can arbitrary assignments (to a mutable locations) <i>in
time</i> by more than one &ldquo;thread&rdquo; be formalized correctly? No. They cannot in
principle (see Joe Armstrong).
</p>

<p>
Can arbitrary nested arrangement of pointers (which themselves are mutable and
live in a mutable memory locations) be <i>stable intermediate building blocks</i>?
No. In principle.
</p>

<p>
This is what all the <i>copying and moving-semantics</i> bullshit is about. How can we
formalize arbitrary mutations and movements of numbers relative to an address space? You
just cannot.
</p>

<p>
How does everything work inside a computer, then? Just like in physics - as long
as nothing really happened to a temporary arrangement.
</p>

<p>
So, what are the answers? Well, use restricted, pure subset of <i>any</i> language
until you cannot. Then partition the code and completely isolate (using interfaces)
 the crap and make the whole thing reverentially-transparent (again) - create a
new cell, lousely speaking, and communicate with it asynchronously, using <i>pure
messages</i>.
</p>

<p>
These are not just Haskell idioms, these are the universal principles (upon
which all of the actual &ldquo;molecular biology&rdquo; has been evolved).
</p>

<p>
The bullshit around C++ is based on the premise that a &ldquo;universal general
purpose <i>imperative</i> language&rdquo; could exist, leave alone be formally defined.
</p>

<p>
No, imperative is a no-go, and this is not just a fancy theoretical finding,
this is a universal principle.
</p>

<p>
Lots of people come to the same conclusions from different directions, because
their observations and conclusions just converge on <i>What Is</i>. The intermediate
forms must be indeed stable, otherwise we have only illusions and hand-waving.
</p>

<p>
This is what Stroustrup does - he insists on a fundamentally wrong thesis by waving
his hands before idiots.
