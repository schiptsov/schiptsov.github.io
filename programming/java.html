The most embarrassing of it all is the idiotic insistence on piling up more
and more imperative crap on designs based on fundamentally unsound
principles, both in the language design and the implementation.
</p>

<p>
The 2000s boom of notoriously crappy Java literature ruined the book industry
forever as a side effect. Now they just print 300+ pages amateur blogposts.
</p>

<p>
A <i>mutable state</i> cannot be guaranteed to remain consistent in an multi-execution
(multi-processor) environment. Only in single-threaded contexts.
</p>

<p>
This is just an evolutionary rejection of an in principle flawed set of
arrangements - this <i>cannot be stable</i>.
</p>

<p>
Imperative crap lacks true cell &ldquo;membranes&rdquo; or non-leaking abstraction
barriers, as well as <i>immutability</i>.
</p>

<p>
Imperative OO crap makes things even worse by providing <i>unsound
/&ldquo;encapsulation&rdquo;</i> of a mutable state - a flawed cell &ldquo;membrane&rdquo;. These
&ldquo;cells&rdquo; are just fundamentally broken.
</p>

<p>
Every method of every object must be designed to be <i>re-enterable</i> (and
have mandatory <i>locks around the state</i>), but, of course, most of the code are not.
</p>

<p>
Java, being an imperative OO clustefuck with inconsistent typing (even
in C++ - the JVM&rsquo;s implementation language!) and shared multi-threaded
design, is doomed to always be buggy and to be exponentially slowing
down in its improvement (already happened) due to not being able to fix
concurrency flaws and subtle bugs - too much time and resources will be spent in vain.
</p>

<p>
Unrestricted (arbitrary) <i>overwriting</i> of memory locations (from another
thread or a process), which we call &ldquo;sharing&rdquo;, cannot be fixed in principle.
</p>

<p>
Java is indeed the monument to human stupidity, and &ldquo;shared mutable state&rdquo;
is manifestation of ignorance and the cause of suffering.
</p>

<p>
First, one cannot model proper <i>asynchronous /message-passing</i> using <i>calls
to methods</i> within a single thread, because a method call implies a
transfer of control with a return address on the stack (a suspension).
It requires <i>sending</i> to a &ldquo;port&rdquo; - a proper RPC.
</p>

<p>
It is not even possible to implement proper <i>share-nothing</i> abstractions
(not even a single byte, leave alone a per-thread <i>call-stack</i>) with
are <i>required</i> for multi-processing in an environment which combines
imperative <i>destructive updates, sharing and multi-threading</i>. Other
people&rsquo;s crappy library code will fuck up everything.
</p>

<p>
Somehow not surprisingly, Java is the second most popular language
(after fucking Javascript), LMAO, while it is just a corporate PHP
turned into a holy catholic Church.
