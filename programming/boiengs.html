The Google Chrome browser has way more &ldquo;details&rdquo; and therefore complexity
than a Boieng 787. This puts into a perspective how complex modern software
became.
</p>

<p>
Notice that just like an aircraft, the Chrome browser is a product built by a
corporation which organizes labor of thousands or people, while no one
understands the whole in its entirety, not even approximately.
</p>

<p>
This, if you think about it for a while, has a lot of implications, including
that in requires a whole industry to produce software and that one has to be
part of this industry, a sub-contractor at least, to make a living.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, like everything else, it boils down to taking your small cut when
other people are willing to spend because of what they want for some reasons.
The <i>demand</i> (the want) is what drives everything in a society.
</p>

<p>
A <i>burnout</i> everyone is talking about nowadays is just burden of the amount of
complexity and seemingly irrelevant details one has to be aware of in order to
understand and understand in order to make a decision.
</p>

<p>
What started 70s and 80s as systems which could, with lots of effort, be
understood in its entirety became a fucking mess which <i>requires</i> huge
organizations to manage and maintain it.
</p>

<p>
This, after some thinking, implies that only a niche programming in a
well-designed, <i>very</i> high-level languages (Ideally - almost perfect DSLs like
MATLAB) is the only viable option for an old-school &ldquo;garage mechanics&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
I absolutely do not want to have anything to do with modern &ldquo;coding&rdquo; in Java
or C++, leave alone doing <i>webshit</i>, with all its &ldquo;stacks&rdquo; and frameworks. This
means out of industry and out of money flows.
</p>

<p>
My things are <code>Erlang</code> and <code>Haskell</code>, <code>Ocaml</code> and <code>Scala 3</code>, even <code>F#</code>.
</p>

<p>
The main problem is that I have no idea <i>what to program</i>. Yes, it <i>seems</i>, that one
should program &ldquo;trading systems&rdquo;, but once you do some <i>actual research</i> you will
realize that there is nothing much to program, because all the theoretical
bullshit is just theoretical bullshit - predictions are impossible in principle.
</p>

<p>
So, it should be a simplest <i>reactive</i> system (instead of a predictive one) that
works (and only simplest systems works reliably), and a such system is
&ldquo;automation&rdquo;, which is the only viable use for small software.
</p>

<p>
I know <i>what, why and how</i>, but the very process of <i>accumulating this knowledge</i>
has burned me out, and  I have literally no desire to actually do it anymore.
</p>

<p>
Even if <code>Scala 3</code> is beautiful and <code>Erlang</code> is a miracle.
