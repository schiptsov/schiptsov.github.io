<h1 class="title">Short History of Programming</h1>
</header><p>
It is remarkable that by the late 70s and early 80s almost every principle has been figured out and all the major problems has been identified, analyzed and &ldquo;solved&rdquo;.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The &ldquo;Structured Programming&rdquo; book has been published in 1972.</li>
<li>Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Principles&rdquo; followed in 1975.</li>
<li>Barbara Liskov&rsquo;s book appaared in the same year.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By then <i>everything</i> high-level has been well-understood and basically &ldquo;solved&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
In the 80s another crucially important tradtion of MIT Scheme culminated in the first <i>standard</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Standard ML</code> along with its ground-breaking <i>type-system</i> has been developed.
</p>

<p>
<code>Smalltalk</code>, which was grossly misunderstood (it was uniformity and underlying message passing <i>using methods</i>  between objects), has been well-established.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps even more remarkable was the unification attempt of <i>lazy languages</i> under the umbrella of <code>Haskell</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Erlang</code>- anothert <i>great</i> language - has been researched in the 90s.
</p>

<p>
By the time of publishing of the first <i>Haskell Report</i> everything is already figured out.
</p>

<p>
The development of <code>Scala</code> in early 2000s has already been standing on the shoulders of the giants.
</p>

<p>
These were the great early traditions. An imperative OO crap fucked everything up.
</p>

<p>
Basically, the <i>worst possible</i> &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; happened between &ldquo;Algol and C&rdquo; traditon and &ldquo;naive&rdquo; (to say the least) imperative OO.
</p>

<p>
An entire OO <i>layers</i> has been developed <i>just right</i> - as strcut-based DSLs - for early lisp (Flawors) and for <code>Common Lisp</code> (CLOS) and for <code>Scheme</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Ocaml</code> added &ldquo;objects and classes&rdquo; just as a <i>sort of</i> a DSL too.
</p>

<p>
However, the process of exteding <code>C</code> with classes (from <code>Symula</code>) and then with <i>generics</i> was, and still is, a disaster. Fucking abominations such as <code>Java</code> has been &ldquo;bestoved upon us&rdquo; by brain-dead &ldquo;designers&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
It is important to undetstand is that adding classes to <code>C</code> was as bad as adding them to <code>PHP</code>, which cultured and educated people would not even mention at a table talk.
</p>

<p>
What is the underlying pattern? Well, languages designed by the math wizards are great, languages designed by narcissistic math-illiterate, uneducared degens (just out of the &ldquo;drive&rdquo;) is what we have, <i>and you can tell.</i>
</p>

<p>
So, by now, the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; choice is to stay with the right &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; tradition of <i>mostly-functional</i> languages such as <code>Ocaml</code> or <code>Scala 3</code>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Pragmatic</i> math-wizards should stick to <code>Haskell</code>.
</p>

<p>
To get a premature enlightenment one has to realized that what Hoare, Liskov has been systematized &ldquo;works&rdquo; for Ladrin&rsquo;s functional languages, because the high-level principles of <i>proper structuring are /universal</i>.
</p>

<p>
The module system of <code>Ocaml</code> (a culmination), which is done <i>just right</i> can be incorporated into any language.
</p>

<p>
Notice that this is the history of <i>discoveries</i> (which began with the <i>Set Abstraction</i> and Abstract Algebra and later with the Lambda Calculus) with contribution (about universality of <i>structuring</i>) from Molecular Biology. This is how one should view and undersrand what programming is <i>really</i>.
</p>

<p>
At the highest and the most abstract level we (<i>good</i> programmers) just <i>strucure information</i>.
</p>

<p>
Structures (&ldquo;abstract shapes of data&rdquo;) and relared <i>ADTs</i> are at the core of programming.
