This is the most fundamental and the most difficult part.
</p>

<p>
How do I know something is good for real (not because some other people are saying so)?
</p>

<p>
How do I know that <code>libc++</code> is good or not? Well, Google Chrome runs on it, it has <code>libc++</code> as a vendeored dependency.
</p>

<p>
Google is arguably the best C++ shop in the world (MS is crap from its first days), and Chrome runs on hundreds of millions devives.
</p>

<p>
The first observation is a <i>heuristic</i>, while the second one is a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; <i>experiment</i>.
</p>

<p>
How do I know that the <code>LLVM</code> toolchain is any good? Well, Google uses it for Android, Apple uses it for iOS, these ran on <i>billions</i> of deveices.
</p>

<p>
Does it mean that I have to use C++? Of course, not.
</p>

<p>
Does it mean that I have to use <code>clang++</code> and <code>libc++</code> if I must use C++? Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
Why this is hard? Because everything is complicated in the real world.
</p>

<p>
How do you know that a drug you have just bought in a pharmacy is good? The partiular part may come from a faulty process, the particular vendor may ignore the safety measures, ingridients from a supply chain may be crappy just this time, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Without proper testing (which, of course, no one does) you cannot tell and have to &ldquo;trust&rdquo; and &ldquo;believe&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
In software we can do neither. We must know and have a proof (not merely a test).
</p>

<p>
Same goes for food. How do you know? Well, you don&rsquo;t. You may have, however, some <i>heuristics</i> which any professional cook will use to evaluate the kitchen, the ingredients and the dishes. This is what we do in the industry.
</p>

<p>
Yes, we just &ldquo;know&rdquo; that things like LLVM (and libc++), or Webkit or Mesa are OK, and things like JVM are <i>not</i> (otherwise they would not have the binding versioning - our shit runs only on this particular versions of the crap).

<h2 id="org7bfd364">Emacs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7bfd364">
<p>
How do I know GNU Emacs is good? Well, it still can be compiled for and runs on <code>MS DOS</code>. Emacs 28.2 is available for DOS (requires the DOS/4GW extender). This tells one something about the quality of the software desing and of the quality of the code.
