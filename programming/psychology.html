<h1 class="title">Psychology</h1>

The fundamental question addressed by any intelligent agent is how NOT
to get stuck in some corner, hitting the wall in a loop.
</p>

<p>
Nature evolved emotions for that, including what we call the feeling of
&ldquo;boredom&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
On a more subtle level, we are quickly losing motivation when activity is not
hormonally (dopamine) and emotionally rewarding, which is right and
efficient.
</p>

<p>
Another heuristic is if what we are doing does not work, especially when
we are trying again and again. It is a hint that we are not qualified
for the task.
</p>

<p>
Now consider some opensource projects. Have you ever trying to build a
working Haskell stack (<code>ghc</code>, <code>cabal-install</code>, <code>stack</code>, and the fucking
abomination called <code>haskell-language-server</code>) from the
sources? You have no idea how fucking frustrating this is. You are
stumbling at each and every step, and the result is still just a fucking
crap.
</p>

<p>
The principial fuckup is that they are trying to verison everything
based on content hashes instead of just having stable interfaces and
increment a fucking number on <i>evety interface change</i>, like our
forefathers did.
</p>

<p>
Trying to set up <code>scala3</code> and <code>metals</code> is little better, but you still have
3 different versions of the <i>scala compiler</i> and a few <i>GB</i> of fucking jars.
</p>

<p>
Please try to understand. Your brain signals you (correctly) that you
are doing something that you should not really do. Yeah, just use
fucking binaries, <code>ghcup</code> and what not. It signals you that it seems to it that
you are ruining yourself.
</p>

<p>
This is not a coincidence that they came up with that crappy idea of versioning
everything, and having <i>3Gb</i> of libraries for a working
<code>haskell-language-server</code> build, which anyway will NOT work with a different version of <code>ghc</code>.
</p>

<p>
These things not just kill motivation, they are really burn you down.
They give you an actual psychological pain.
</p>

<p>
So, it seems that modern CS requires some Rocky Balboa kind of character
and self-determination, which is not supposed to be this way.
</p>

<p>
Habitual introspection and breathing techniques for relaxation is of
some help, but it is still just fucking frustrating to actually
experience the fact that the whole field
is now dominated by literal idiots and low effort bloatware crap.
