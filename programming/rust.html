I came up with some <i>enlightened</i> and precise definition of <i>why</i> some languages  feel
so crappy, like PHP, which is, as we know, <i>the fractal of bad design</i>.
</p>

<p>
I have been reading a definitive <code>Rust</code> book, full of supposedly idiomatic,
well-chosen examples, and I  regularly cringe <i>intuitively</i> without being able to
articulate exactly why. It just <i>feels</i> crappy at some examples. Now I can articulate <i>why</i>.
</p>

<p>
The language &ldquo;designers&rdquo; and community contributors are <i>math-illiterate</i>. This
and only this. It feels exactly as if some <code>PHP</code> coders are designing a better <code>SML</code> for
systems programming, without understanding <i>why</i>  <code>SML</code> or <code>Ocaml</code> are the way they
are.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-rust"><span style="color: #81A1C1;">pub</span> <span style="color: #81A1C1;">fn</span> <span style="color: #88C0D0;">notify</span><span style="color: #81A1C1;">&lt;</span><span style="color: #D8DEE9;">T</span>: <span style="color: #8FBCBB;">Summary</span> + <span style="color: #8FBCBB;">Display</span><span style="color: #81A1C1;">&gt;(</span><span style="color: #D8DEE9;">item</span>: <span style="color: #ECEFF4; background-color: #2E3440;">&amp;</span><span style="color: #8FBCBB;">T</span><span style="color: #81A1C1;">)</span>;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This is the syntax for constraining an <i>abstract type</i> with multiple &ldquo;trait bounds&rdquo; as they call
it.
</p>

<p>
The operation they are trying to denote is a <i>Set Union</i>. A <i>star</i> <code>*</code> (for a <i>product</i>)
would be appropriate. The <code>+</code> is mathematically a fundamentally
different operation. This particular choice makes one cringe.
</p>

<p>
The math experts who have designed SML have used <code>*</code> for product types.
</p>

<p>
Here, in Rust, this is NOT a product type, but it is a <i>product of two traits</i>. The
precise meaning is a <i>product of two named Sets of type-signatures</i>. Not a <i>sum</i>.
</p>

<p>
Another cringe is that they use <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> on collections, as if they are
<i>stacks</i>, but this is OK because the idiots were those who designed the <code>C++</code>
collections.
</p>

<p>
There are a few more, mostly in naming of the methods, which I think is an
intention, to make everything look familiar to <code>C++</code> developers,  but my generalization is obviously adequate and correct.
</p>

<p>
<code>Scala</code> feels so much better because the designers came from the right <code>SML</code> tradition,
and are <i>math experts</i>. Odersky is the <i>Giga Chad</i>, you know.
</p>

<p>
Also the lack of a <i>uniform pattern-matching everywhere</i>, like in <code>SML</code>, <code>Ocaml</code> or
<code>F#</code> is a cringe too. As if they just thrown away the most important thing because
they did not get it, again, by being <i>math-illiterate</i>. They could, at least, have
a look at <code>Erlang</code>, which is a <i>high-level system language</i>.
</p>

<p>
By comparing <code>Rust</code> with <code>Scala</code> we could see how and why a <i>principle-guided /attention do
details</i> really matters. <code>Rust</code> feels <i>PHP&rsquo;sque</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is worth knowing that guys at <code>AT&amp;T Bell Labs</code>, who have designed the <i>Basis
library</i> (an <i>stdlib</i>) have explored the possibility of using <code>SML/NJ</code> for system
programming, and there were no problem with the syntax and semantics of the
<code>SML</code>.
