<h1 class="title">The f*ck off code</h1>
</header><p>
Most of the code other people write is a <i>fuck off</i> code - once it is pushed away
it becomes <i>someone else&rsquo;s problem</i>.
</p>

<p>
The main assumption is that one will never see the code again, and other people
(in an organization or whoever it may be) would have to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that you are writing a small system with would <i>trade your own money</i>
on a crypto exchange (using an API). Suddenly you want it to be absolutely
correct, error free, and to document every single step you have taken.
</p>

<p>
Not just that - when you will look at the code a half-of-a-year later you want
to remember <i>justification of every design and data-structure decision</i> which
you have made, to be sure that every algorithm on that kind of data has been
done right, and how you can <i>be sure</i> of it.
</p>

<p>
Now every &ldquo;safe&rdquo; functional programming technique is making a lot of sense to
you and you probably want all your code to be pure, without imperative loops,
without destructive updates (immutable data). You want it to be as pure, correct and
eternal as math itself.
</p>

<p>
You probably want everything to be  <i>formally verified</i>, but that&rsquo;s a dream.
</p>

<p>
If you program as if you are writing your own money managing system, then and
only then you really do. Everything else is just a crappy, low-effort &ldquo;fuck off&rdquo; code.
</p>

<p>
Most of corporate code is a &ldquo;fuck off&rdquo; code for obvious psychological and
organization-structural reasons. Once you build an army of easily replaceable
coding &ldquo;drones&rdquo; you will get a steady smelling stream of the &ldquo;fuck off&rdquo; code.
