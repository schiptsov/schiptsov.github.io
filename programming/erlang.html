<h1 class="title">Erlang</h1>
</header><p>
<i>Erlang</i> (as a project) did everything right. They began with fundamental principles
and serious research and found out that <i>Java is fundamentally flawed</i>
(and published this finding in the Joe Armstrong&rsquo;s thesis and in the books).
</p>

<p>
There is the principle which hardware designers knew all along - one
cannot made a truly asynchronous (non-blocking) system with blocking
primitives. This is why they have <i>interrupts</i>, <i>queues</i>, <i>ports</i> and <i>buses</i>.
</p>

<p>
Another fundamental principle is <i>total isolation</i> of processes (<i>to share nothing</i>, not
a single byte). In the hardware world this is taken for granted.
</p>

<p>
The only way to communicate between totally isolated entities is <i>message
passing</i>. This principle goes all the way down to cell (and even
within-a-cell) communication in biology.
</p>

<p>
That message passing must be truly asynchronous (they
call it &ldquo;send and pray&rdquo;) because &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; does not work in biology
(the principle which Evolution &ldquo;found out&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
One cannot use just ordinary <i>procedure calls</i> (which use stack), so they
invented the <code>spawn</code>  asynchronous primitive.
</p>

<p>
It takes a <i>functional closure</i>, its arguments (everything is, of course,
immutable values), and create a new, fully
isolated, share-nothing lightweight process with <i>eventually</i> will run
that closure and communicate the result back via asynchronous message.
</p>

<p>
Erlang&rsquo;s processes are executed and scheduled by other totally
isolated processes, <i>within a supervision hierarchy</i>. Message-delivery
subsystem is also isolated and supervised, and it began with the
properly designed <i>runtime system</i> which <i>guarantee the share-nothing
properties</i> of the lightweight processes.
</p>

<p>
There is a catch. If your stack does not use these <i>share-nothing</i>,
asynchronous primitives (implemented without any sharing), you have an
illusion of asynchronity.
</p>

<p>
Not just that, if your implementation language is an imperative crap
with objects, exceptions and multi-threading - you are fucked. These
things simply do not combine into a coherent whole.
</p>

<p>
Pure functions, persistent data structures, isolation of processes and
asynchronous message-passing (with append-only mailboxes) <i>together</i> solve
the problems, and Erlang designers and researchers got it right.
</p>

<p>
Since then Clojure and Akka are striving to achieve some similar
results, but the problem is that its target platform (the runtime) is
not designed for true asynchronity - it only <i>emulates</i> it using blocking
and sharing primitives.

<p>
It seems, at least in theory, the <code>Erlang</code> is the best language for writing
advanced client applications - it has the right implementation of &ldquo;core&rdquo;
protocols and underlying low level primitives, such as <i>processes communicating
through asynchronous message passing</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, no non-bullshit implementation of the websockets protocol,
particularly OTP does not support it yet.
</p>

<p>
It seems that frames and message maps particularly nice to <i>pattern-matching on
receive</i>, which is the Erlang&rsquo;s killer feature, and an these &ldquo;messages&rdquo; are an
appropriate level of abstraction to work with.
</p>

<p>
Someone has to write it, but the problem is a niche language (even good one)
requires a lot of time to become familiar and requires to read <i>a lot</i> of cryptic
code which requires good understanding of the underlying model and abstractions.
</p>

<p>
No one does such kind of work for free, because it requires <i>months</i> of
uninterrupted effort, but food and money has to come from somewhere.

Erlang OTP team have done a great job for maintaining the <code>ssl</code> library, but now
there must be an easy way to let it use <code>/etc/ssl/certs/</code> or <code>/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts</code>
