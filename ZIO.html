This project <a href="https://zio.dev/">https://zio.dev/</a> turns out to be a representative example of what
is going on in modern software development.
</p>

<p>
The complementary set of videos &ldquo;ZIO from Scratch&rdquo; (can be found at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ziverge">https://www.youtube.com/@Ziverge</a>) is especially nice, and illustrates that the
clear articulation of the principles (the reason) behind every single design or
implementation decisions leads to a way better code.
</p>

<p>
Recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy">https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy</a> produced the similar set of
&ldquo;from the first principles&rdquo; videos, which is a good thing.
</p>

<p>
So, what is going on there? Well, <i>a lot</i> at different levels simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Lets begin from seemingly very far away. A human language has been evolved to
communicate information about things in our shared environment. It is
<i>naturally</i> (universally) evolved to have different kinds (not classes) of words
to <i>refer to</i> different aspects of what happens in the shared environment -
&ldquo;things&rdquo;, &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; and &ldquo;actions&rdquo; or &ldquo;ongoing processes&rdquo;, which, of course,
corresponds to nouns, adjectives and verbs. Again, this behavior naturally
emerged because the environment has its constraints and &ldquo;laws&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
At a higher level of a human language model there are &ldquo;standards idioms&rdquo;, which are
<i>distinct patterns</i> people lean to use to some recurring observations or in <i>similar contexts</i>.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental principle is that a proper language use stays close to reality
and technically is just an encoding and decoding. At least it should be this
way.
</p>

<p>
Conceptually, very similar things happen in the world of programming language
semantics - generalized notions (for a commonly observed patterns) and
corresponding <i>standard idioms</i> emerge and we are seeing the same things over and
over again at different levels of abstraction.
</p>

<p>
When we try to at least enumerate the &ldquo;core&rdquo; abstractions, we ultimately end up with
&ldquo;arrows&rdquo; and &ldquo;dots&rdquo; and a very few <i>common &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; or &ldquo;forms&rdquo;</i> made out of these.
</p>

<p>
At the very essence we can not just enumerate and count all the possible arrows
between the dots in a particular arrangement, but even <i>observe</i> that these are
<i>all possible arrows</i> out there.
</p>

<p>
These notions lead to further generalized notions, such that of a &ldquo;path&rdquo;
(<i>connected arrows</i>) and at the levels of paths, to the notions of reaching the
same &ldquo;destination&rdquo;, etc.
</p>

<p>
Being classified and then rigorously defined, these notions got their own names
and their common properties got their own distinct names too. This is how we got
things like <i>Functor</i> or <i>commutativity</i> or that notion that a <i>diagram commutes</i>.
</p>

<p>
At the level of programming languages, both semantics and implementation, we
have discovered similar generalized patterns too.
</p>

<p>
Arguably, the most fundamental one is what we call &ldquo;dispatch&rdquo; or &ldquo;branching&rdquo;, to
which various kinds of <i>structured pattern-matching</i> expressions corresponds.
</p>

<p>
Your CPU does dispatch on a current <i>machine instruction</i>, JVM does dispatch on
JVM <i>byte-codes</i>, a LISP interpreter does dispatch on a <i>structure of particular
special forms</i>.
</p>

<p>
The generalized process is, of course. called an <i>interpreter</i>, and this is a
Universal Notion (this is why MIT professors wear funny hats on these videos).
</p>

<p>
Going back to the &ldquo;core&rdquo; notions and patterns, it turns out that being <i>too
general</i>, like <i>untyped</i> Lambda Calculus/ is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; (leads to paradoxes) and being
too strict (as a <i>machine code</i>) is also bad (both are the extremes to be
avoided).
</p>

<p>
By trial and error we (the programming language community) has discovered that
<i>type-systems</i> (which partitions the universe of values, check the constraints and
provide some guarantees) is a must have, and even <i>evolved</i> what seems to be
<i>&ldquo;just right&rdquo;</i> type system (Scala3 and Haskell are at the cutting edge of this).
</p>

<p>
Everything is good and true when we deal with a pure mathematical expressions
that never fail (and abstract syntax trees made out of those). But there are
other &ldquo;things&rdquo; that night happen within a computation.
</p>

<p>
So eventually we extend our basic universal <i>interpreters</i> to the notions of
&ldquo;callback&rdquo; and &ldquo;continuations&rdquo; (which are basically closures that also capture
parts of the context), to &ldquo;fibers&rdquo; (which ware essentially closures, but with
fundamentally different <i>run-time properties</i> - they run differently). We also
have &ldquo;errors&rdquo; (to which the right notions are &ldquo;termination&rdquo;, &ldquo;restarts&rdquo; or
&ldquo;back-tracking&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
Having all this we still want to retain the fundamental properties of having
<i>pure declarative languages</i> (or at least <i>pure subsets</i>) and the <i>referential
transparency property</i> which is necessary and sufficient to <i>implement</i> interpreters
of such pure declarative languages.
</p>

<p>
If everything is done just right, we would have some emergent properties of
a whole system, which we also call &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; or &ldquo;safeties&rdquo; - <i>&ldquo;type-safety&rdquo;,
&ldquo;stack safety&rdquo;, &ldquo;concurrency safety&rdquo; and even &ldquo;resource safety&rdquo;. All this just
means that everything has been defined declaratively and will be interpreted
/&ldquo;mechanically&rdquo;</i> by a machine - some simple <i>stack-bases virtual machine, which is
an emergent architecture for an generalized interpreter</i>.
</p>

<p>
All these &ldquo;nice things&rdquo; (a pure declarative language and its interpreter) can be
packaged as an <i>advanced high-level library</i> for a modern, principle based
language with and <i>advanced type-system</i> (which, of course, contains all these
things <i>within itself</i>).
</p>

<p>
The benefits are that we use this advanced host-language with its most advanced
type-system to implement our <i>simple /but just done right</i> declarative language.
The type-systems then <i>guarantees</i> the soundness and &ldquo;safety&rdquo; of our simple
languages, in which we can program our stuff.
</p>

<p>
All these <i>nested interpreters</i> (through JVM up to CPU), at least in theory/ just
reduce the level of details within corresponding level of abstraction, while,
and this is the point, retaining the high-level fundamental properties and the
resulting &ldquo;soundness&rdquo; and &ldquo;safety&rdquo; at the cost of enormous, catastrophic
redundancy.
</p>

<p>
And <i>this</i> is what the ZIO project aims to achieve. It packages a simple declative
DSL and its <i>async-aware interpreter</i> as an advaced Scala library, <i>delegating the
/actual implementation</i> of all the <i>really scary shit</i> (low-level concurrency
primitives, a less buggy async runtime) to the JVM, in hope that there will be
some <i>other people</i> to blame for inevitable failures (JVM itself is an imperative
OO C++98 crap, - subject to all the problems we are trying to avoid with out
simple declarative DSLs).
</p>

<p>
Whether or not ZIO does the <i>theoretically-optimal</i> things (uses proper Monads,
does not over-abstract with bullshit, etc) is the subject of another long rant,
but it is crucially important to realize that there ARE such <i>optimal
abstractions</i> - the criteria is that they <i>closely and accurately capture</i>
(completely and without redundancy) the relevant aspects of the world
(sequences, forks and joins are examples of such aspects).
</p>

<p>
Higher-level abstractions like <i>Events</i> and <i>Streams</i> and or <i>Channels</i> are &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
and essential, so it is good when they have their own corresponding pure,
declarative DSLs.
</p>

<p>
Shall we use ZIO2? Well, it grossly simplifies the thinking, adds some
&ldquo;mathematical rigor&rdquo; and provides the advertised &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; at the cost of
running tons of imperative crap. So, definitely YES.
