</header><p>
Evolved Biological structures which match the environment. Recognition of
recurring patterns (outcomes of processes). Storing language-endoded &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;
within a shared culture. Random fluctuations (Brownian motion) withing a current social context.
</p>

<p>
The main point is that we have to always &ldquo;zoom back&rdquo; from abstractions to the
actual patterns observed in Reality, from which a particular abstraction has
been generalized.
</p>

<p>
The mind easily goes in the way of producing generalizations, but have hard time
to unwind them back to the sources.
</p>

<p>
The mind of an observer &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; captured generalities and produced the universal notions of &ldquo;and also&rdquo;, &ldquo;either or&rdquo;,
of an &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; and of a &ldquo;composition&rdquo; of two &ldquo;arrows&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The generalized notion of a Set is an orthogonal - it captures the grouping and
classification aspect of the mind.
</p>

<p>
Notice that classifications &ldquo;exist&rdquo; and valid because the physical constraints
are the same &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; we observe, and that &ldquo;everything&rdquo; has been <i>evolved</i> by
a process of gradual improvement (so where the individual &ldquo;paths&rdquo; form a tree).
</p>

<h2 id="org461747e">Generalizations and specializations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org461747e">
<p>
Our brains have been evolved to recognize commonalities and generalize on them.
</p>

<p>
Commonalities are <i>out there</i> because the process of <i>Evolution</i>, which produced
everything has a shape of an <i>acyclic graph</i>, where everything has its &ldquo;parent
nodes&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Thus generalization on what we call <i>species</i> is valid not because someone have
said so, but because they are indeed <i>branches of the same parent nodes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Animals do not posses any kind of concepts whatsoever, but their brain structure
<i>generalize into species</i> just by <i>pattern-recognition</i> and grouping. Animals are aware
of their own kind and other kinds, and know which are harmless and which are
dangerous.
</p>

<p>
There is no abstractions whatsoever, pure pattern-recognition. This ability
happen to evolve <i>because different kinds or species are out there</i>. Again, <i>What
Is</i> comes prior to any valid concepts, before mathematics and logic. Both are
made of <i>generalized patterns</i> and generalized rules. The fundamental notions of
<code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> are both such generalized patterns. So are addition, multiplication
(as repeated addition) and exponentiation (as repeated multiplication) of Whole
or Natural Numbers.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sets</i> are also generalizations of observed recurring patterns, and it can be
thought of as a embedded DSL. Embedded in what we call logic.
</p>

<p>
Acyclic graphs, by the way, are literally everywhere, because they mimic (or
represent) a <i>resulting path</i> of an evolution of any process which unfolds in distinct steps
(transitions, or changes).
</p>

<p>
This is, of course, why logic, sets and graphs are our <i>universal</i> modeling
tools - they are &ldquo;taken&rdquo; from <i>What Is</i>.
</p>

<p>
The most interesting part is that math and logic has been discovered and refined
by endless individual <i>trial-and-error</i> processes, which eventually <i>converge</i> on
What Is, while <i>pruning put</i> an abstract bullshit.
</p>

<p>
There is no <i>intelligence</i> aside from systematic <i>trial-and-error</i>. Science emerged
as a methodology (set of explicit rules) to do this trial-and-error
<i>systematically</i> - with proper back-racking, pruning, etc.
</p>

<p>
The systematic <i>search</i> and <i>exploration</i> has been studied by AI pioneers.
</p>

<p>
It is important things to understand that the observed results are very
different from the process which produced them. The process by which
intermediate results has been selected and incorporated into a language-based shared human
culture as &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; was of <i>trial-and-error</i> - pseudo-random fluctuations,
bound by individual <i>social contexts</i>, which are vastly complex (as Brownian
Motion).
</p>

<p>
The operational definition of intelligence is the ability, to use maintain an
over-simplified, generalized (which absract away as many details as possible)
inner &ldquo;map&rdquo; of the environment (the territory), and use this inner &ldquo;map&rdquo; for
selecting actions, and for humans alone - the additional ability to use the stable intermediate results available in the
shared linguistic environment, which we call &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The ability to lean to use language-based methods (knowledge encoded in terms of
a language) is what distinguish humans from other species. It is a language and
only language which makes us special.

<h2 id="org8563c7d">Weighted sums</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8563c7d">
<p>
The sums of scaled factors are everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Most of the meaningful operations are &ldquo;scaling&rdquo; of one &ldquo;object&rdquo; by another. Matrix
by another matrix, a function by another function, a polynomial by another
polynomial.
</p>

<p>
The general theme is scaling of the terms of the same kind and adding them up.
This generalization too can be traced back to What Is.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc4cec82">
<p>
<i>Abstraction by parameterisation, references, nesting</i> and the <i>rule-governed
/substitution model</i> are <i>good-enough</i> for everything. This is a fundamental theoretical
result, and it is good exercise to trace everything back to <i>What Is</i>.
</p>

<p>
The ability to evaluate long <i>nested</i> expressions by reducing one distinct piece
(a <i>redex</i>) at a time is, again, a generalized pattern, generalized from how to think
rigorously using words of a language.
</p>

<p>
Nesting establishes an implicit <i>order</i>. Inner &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; has to be <i>eventually</i> (not
necessarily right now) reduced <i>prior to</i> the outer ones.
</p>

<p>
Nesting of expressions is the way to <i>structure</i> or to shape the resulting
processes. Nothing in Lambda Calculus is arbitrary, incidental or redundant
.

<div id="outline-container-org40566d1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org40566d1">Sums and Products</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org40566d1">
<p>
The <i>meaning</i>, captured in a generalized notion of an <i>isomorphism</i> and apparent
<i>duality</i> of constructions of the Category Theiry for a sum (<code>a | b</code>) and a product
(<code>a, b</code>) is that two &ldquo;atoms&rdquo;, lets say, could be potentially <i>observed</i> either together (in a compound
structure) or one or another independently. This, of course, is a universal fact
(ignoring all the actual electo-chemical constraints).
</p>

<p>
Another important generalization is that for a <i>product-type</i> we will always
have &ldquo;selectors&rdquo;, which can be derived mechanically, and for <i>sum-types</i> we will
always have a <i>patterns-matching expression</i>, with a distinct <i>clause</i> for each
possibility.
</p>

<p>
The other way to say is that is that the set of all <i>selectors</i> for a
<i>product-type</i> and the set of all <i>clauses</i> in a pattern-matching expression are
the same kind of &ldquo;arrows&rdquo; (mappings).
</p>

<p>
A <i>sum-type</i> will always have multiple data-constructors, while there can be a
single data-constructor for a product type, but it can be <i>partially applied</i>.

<div id="outline-container-org78729e7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org78729e7">Arrows, Arrows Everywhere</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org78729e7">
<p>
When we start to think &ldquo;visually&rdquo; in terms of arrows, it is quite easy to mess
everything up by not being able to distinguish between different kinds of arrows
or by connecting unrelated dots from &ldquo;orthogonal dimensions&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Just like the original Lambda Calculus, &ldquo;untyped&rdquo; arrows are too general.
</p>

<p>
So, we need to <i>partition</i> the universe of discourse, just like introducing
<i>abstraction barriers</i>, to separate different kinds of arrows from each other.
</p>

<p>
<i>Flows-Charts</i> of our forefathers were also full of arrows, they are at the
different dimension form the arrows in <i>type-signatures</i>.
</p>

<p>
Our arrows may form <i>pipelines</i> or <i>paths</i>, <i>potential</i> (which can be taken) or <i>actual</i>
(which has been taken).
</p>

<p>
So, when we see &ldquo;arrows&rdquo; in a pattern-matching expression these are <i>all</i> the
potential paths out there, but only one can be taken at a time.
</p>

<p>
When we see &ldquo;arrows&rdquo; as a set of selectors, <i>some or all</i> of them can be taken in
any order.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, calling all the selectors will result in the same value of a
<i>product type</i>, while only one clause can be used to get the value of a <i>sum-type</i>,
which is, of course, again, corresponds to the notions of <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga07e5ed" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga07e5ed">Currying is a serious thing.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga07e5ed">
<p>
Notice that <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> is actually a <i>tree</i>, with the leftmost arrows being omitted.
</p>

<p>
It captures the notion that &ldquo;the next step&rdquo; is not the <i>transformation</i>, but
<i>taking in</i> one more &ldquo;required component&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
By the way, In Molecular Biology (for a <i>enzyme</i>) that would be literally &ldquo;waiting
until a particular structure to appears in my locality&rdquo;, which shows which abstract notions are valid and which are ephemeral
products of the mind of an observer. Waiting in time is ephemeral, locality
isn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;At the same time&rdquo; means at &ldquo;the same locality&rdquo;, and from there the
proper notion of being &ldquo;unrelated&rdquo; arizes.
</p>

<p>
Notice also that when referenced by name (not the actual position), arguments
form a <i>Product</i> (not a <i>sequence or a list</i>).
</p>

<p>
Sums and Products are defined to be <i>unordered (or orderless)</i>, just like Sets.
</p>

<p>
This leads to the possibility to express everything in terms of just &ldquo;arrows and
dots&rdquo; and this is what the Category Theory does.

<h2 id="orgfd9657c">Interpreter as a universal abstract machine</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfd9657c">
<p>
<i>Dispatch on a distinct pattern</i> is at the core of any interpreter. This is not
an arbitrary result, it is another <i>generalization</i>.
</p>

<p>
The process of transcription of DNA or RNA involves a &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; interpreter,
which does structural patten-matching, literally.

Sequences are another generalization of the <i>fundamental</i> and universal pattern too.

A Stack is a specialization of a  sequence - an ultimate ADT.
