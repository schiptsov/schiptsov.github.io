<h1 class="title">Gamma</h1>
</header><p>
I like to write these sort of modern Upanishads. This is how I cope with
drowning in bullshit.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf7e8535" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf7e8535">\(\Gamma\)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf7e8535">
<p>
This is small bit of notation \(\Gamma \vdash A\) in Gentzen&rsquo;s Natural Deduction
formalism, which is usually ignored, is actually the key to everything.
</p>

<p>
It, accidentally and intuitively, it seems, reflects how the mind works
in principle. Any <i>language-based</i> human mind.
</p>

<p>
It stands for &ldquo;what is already known&rdquo;. A set of &ldquo;facts&rdquo; and <i>assumptions</i>.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that we can&rsquo;t tell which assumptions are valid, because
they are <i>socially conditioned</i> and implanted in the <i>dynamic
representations</i> (or &ldquo;maps&rdquo;), which our brains continuously build, update
and maintain, by a language-based shared cultures.
</p>

<p>
The most famous such assumptions are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>death is not the end (something survives destruction of the body).</li>
<li><i>I am That</i> of Upanishads (less wrong).</li>
<li>A drop of water which eventually returns back into the ocean.</li>
<li><i>Neti, neti</i> &#x2013; not this, not that (the famous argument of Upanishads)</li>
<li><p>
time exists and can accelerate or slow down
etc.
</p>

<p>
These things are socially conditioned or literally <i>implanted</i> (as
memes) by a shared language-based culture, and
for most people these things are valid <i>assumptions</i> or something they
&ldquo;know&rdquo;.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7c6b41b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7c6b41b">The art of making a convincing argument</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c6b41b">
<p>
This is what is in common between religious, abstract philosophy, abstract
mathematics, theoretical physics and any kind of abstract theories in
general.
</p>

<p>
Someone created a convincing argument out of words (and words alone), put
it in print, usually in a symbolic form, and this augment, eventually,
becomes a <i>common social construct</i>, accepted as an <i>assumption</i>. All religions
has been created in exactly this way.
</p>

<p>
It has been implanted in \(\Gamma\) as something &ldquo;already known&rdquo;, and the
machinery of the mind keeps pilling up more &ldquo;facts&rdquo; <i>upon it</i>.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is that simple and fundamental. All the notions of <i>contexts</i> or
<i>environments</i> or any sets of &ldquo;facts&rdquo; is just an intuitive reflection of
how the mind works in principle. Any mind.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org92ebaf4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org92ebaf4">Mind &ldquo;sees&rdquo; only its own \(\Gamma\)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org92ebaf4">
<p>
Besides emotion and feeling driven (dopamine, etc) so-called <i>animal
mind</i> we have this &ldquo;thinking in a language&rdquo; human mind. These major subsystems
work in parallel and supposed to complement each other and never be &ldquo;in
a conflict&rdquo; about anything in &ldquo;reality outside of our heads&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Grossly oversimplifying, when some sensory input draws our focus to a
recognized pattern such as a stray cat, the brain &ldquo;loads&rdquo; related or
linked <i>language-based thoughts</i> too.
</p>

<p>
While visual patterns which correspond to stray cats are almost the same
(they, obviously, slightly differ upon actual conditioning - what kinds of cats
you have seen. Cats are very different in topics) the related
<i>language-based contexts</i> are very different.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental principle is that a &ldquo;thinking in words language&rdquo; mind
never &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the actual cat (only sensory processing brain circuitry
does) but brain&rsquo;s <i>inner representation of it</i>.
</p>

<p>
The mind only &ldquo;sees&rdquo; or can access to <i>its own stuff</i>. Its \(\Gamma\).
Everything else follows from this and is more or less easy (once you
understand the principle).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0da1fd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb0da1fd">The brain can&rsquo;t tell.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0da1fd">
<p>
Given an arbitrary sentence in a human language a brain can tell whether
it is well-formed or not and what &ldquo;inner representation&rdquo; it is <i>related
to</i> &#x2013; the brain will &ldquo;load or prime up or form&rdquo; what we call a &ldquo;context&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
What the brain cannot tell is whether or not is bullshit, or partially
bullshit. Again, the brain evolved in an environment where bullshit
and delusions never existed.
</p>

<p>
Delusions and bullshit arise from use of a language and language-based
&ldquo;thinking&rdquo; and this is what the ancients called &ldquo;the veil of Maya&rdquo; (which
conceals and distorts reality), which is the actual cause of most of our suffering and
fundamental problems.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that almost everything we &ldquo;know&rdquo; and &ldquo;think&rdquo; is utter
bullshit, because our inner representations (our inner \(\Gamma\) is pulluted
by bullshit and infeseted by <i>semantic viruses</i> what we call memes.)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9cef719" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9cef719">a Jigsaw puzzle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9cef719">
<p>
What a brain can do is to match against already completed parts of a
<i>Jigsaw puzzle</i>, which by definition does not have any single
contradiction in it, and discard what does not fit (or contradicts). And
this is, literally, the best strategy we could have.
</p>

<p>
And it does. We have very bad feeling (a sounding alarm) when suddenly
our assumptions are invalidated. This is a signal that we are <i>delusional</i>
and this is very bad for survival.
</p>

<p>
Having an adequate &ldquo;inner map&rdquo; (however oversimplified but not wong or
distorted) of a territory is crucial for survival. Think of a &ldquo;map&rdquo; as
partially completed &ldquo;jigsaw puzzle&rdquo;
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd45e4db" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd45e4db">Bullshit, bullshit everywhere.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd45e4db">
<p>
A brain cannot tell which sensory and linguistic input is bullshit. It
has been evolved to on assumption (LOL) that <i>there is no delusion, lies or
bullshit in the world</i>. Animal&rsquo;s minds are almost never confused about
their environment.
</p>

<p>
Delusion arises as abstract concepts, which made out of words of a
language enters our mind. Words are supposed to be just labels for
things, attibutes and processes, but something went wrong.
