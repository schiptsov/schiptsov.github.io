<h1 class="title">My hacks</h1>
</header><p>
I think I am a <i>hacker</i> in the original sense of the early <a href="HN.html">HN</a> (which,
unironically banned me 10 times in a row).
</p>

<p>
I am hacking things most of you do not know even exist.
</p>

<p>
I hacked &ldquo;Category Theory&rdquo; by realizing that <i>inversing of arrows</i> is an
illegal operation in any context outside of the theory (a <i>type-error</i>),
so an assumed <i>isomorphism</i> between a <code>sum</code> and a <code>product</code> is
immaterial.
</p>

<p>
Just think of it - a <i>fork</i> is fundamentally different structural
pattern than a <i>join</i> and their relation is only apparent (a confusion
of the mind of an external observer thinking <i>too abstractly</i>).
</p>

<p>
A <i>&ldquo;fork&rdquo;</i> is isomorphic to a <i>&ldquo;join&rdquo;</i> only in streams of a liquid and,
perhaps, in streams of data, but it is not in general.
</p>

<p>
This is what happens with abstract theories - they might contain some
insights and useful formalism tightly mixed with utter bullshit.
</p>

<p>
Causality (the source of any <i>directions</i>) and hence <i>arrows</i> cannot be
 reversed. Any such assumed reverse is a <i>logical error</i> (while the only
 valid logic is the one based on the Causality Principle which underlies the
Universe).
</p>

<p>
I hacked other &ldquo;type errors&rdquo; too, especially attempts to apply
mathematical logic (in which <code>False</code> implies anything) to the aspects of
<i>What Is</i>.
</p>

<p>
I hacked the difference between <code>AND ALSO</code> and <code>AND THEN</code> which
distinguish between an <i>unordered</i> pair (commutative) and an <i>ordered</i>
pair (an arrow, which is an abstraction for a <i>single step</i>, which implies a
<i>direction</i>).
</p>

<p>
I hacked trading of crypto by collapsing mountains of pseudo-scientific
bullshit modeling which can be shown to be irrelevant abstract bullshit.
</p>

<p>
I forgot some of my other hacks. I have to re-read notes.
</p>

<p>
I solved <i>yoga</i>. It all reduces to gradually develop habitual <i>deep
abdominal breathing</i> (with your belly) through the <i>nose</i>. One could collect the data and
experimentally confirm that <i>mouth-breathers</i>  (<i>shallow, &ldquo;upper chest&rdquo;
breathing</i>) have lesser lifespan than abdominal guys (divers, swimmers,
runners, mountain porters).
</p>

<p>
It is that fundamental and being overlooked exactly because it is so
fundamental. Osanas and yoga pants are irrelevant. Changing the way you
breath when you sleep - this is the ultimate goal of real ancient yoga.
</p>

<p>
Real Buddhist <i>practices</i> are  the yoga of developing habitual continuous introspection, by
the way. Nothing to do with daikinis or tankas.
