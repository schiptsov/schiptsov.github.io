    </header>
    <p>I think I am a <i>hacker</i> in the original sense of the
    early <a href="HN.html">HN</a> (which, unironically banned me
    10 times in a row).</p>
    <p>I am hacking things most of you do not know even exist.</p>
    <p>I hacked “Category Theory” by realizing that <i>inversing of
    arrows</i> is an illegal operation in any context outside of
    the theory (a <i>type-error</i>), so an assumed
    <i>isomorphism</i> between a <code>sum</code> and a
    <code>product</code> is immaterial.</p>
    <p>Just think of it - a <i>fork</i> is fundamentally different
    structural pattern than a <i>join</i> and their relation is
    only apparent (a confusion of the mind of an external observer
    thinking <i>too abstractly</i>).</p>
    <p>A <i>“fork”</i> is isomorphic to a <i>“join”</i> only in
    streams of a liquid and, perhaps, in streams of data, but it is
    not in general.</p>
    <p>This is what happens with abstract theories - they might
    contain some insights and useful formalism tightly mixed with
    utter bullshit.</p>
    <p>Causality (the source of any <i>directions</i>) and hence
    <i>arrows</i> cannot be reversed. Any such assumed reverse is a
    <i>logical error</i> (while the only valid logic is the one
    based on the Causality Principle which underlies the
    Universe).</p>
    <p>I hacked other “type errors” too, especially attempts to
    apply mathematical logic (in which <code>False</code> implies
    anything) to the aspects of <i>What Is</i>.</p>
    <p>I hacked the difference between <code>AND ALSO</code> and
    <code>AND THEN</code> which distinguish between an
    <i>unordered</i> pair (commutative) and an <i>ordered</i> pair
    (an arrow, which is an abstraction for a <i>single step</i>,
    which implies a <i>direction</i>).</p>
    <p>I hacked trading of crypto by collapsing mountains of
    pseudo-scientific bullshit modeling which can be shown to be
    irrelevant abstract bullshit.</p>
    <p>I forgot some of my other hacks. I have to re-read
    notes.</p>
