    <p>The notion of a context is a <i>universal</i> one.</p>
    <p>A set of name-value (or name-concept) directed pairs or
    <i>bindings</i> is called an <i>environment</i> or a
    <i>context</i> (when it is being passing along).</p>
    <p>In logic it corresponds to the set \(\Gamma\)</p>
    <p>In programming it is the <i>global namespace</i>.</p>
    <p>A local context in programming is a <i>lexical closure</i>
    which <i>captures</i> the values of all “free” variables.</p>
    <p>Expressions are always evaluated within some context and can
    contain occurrences of the names (references) found in that
    context.</p>
    <p>This is the core of any system of logic. What is already
    proven is in \(\G\).</p>
    <p>The evaluator will use the definitions associated with these
    names as rules for simplifiying (reducing) expressions.</p>
    <p>Mathematical thinking is a whole way of looking at things,
    of stripping them down to their numerical, structural, or
    logical essentials, and of analyzing the underlying
    patterns.</p>
    <p>The meaning of an expression is its value and there are no
    other effects, hidden or otherwise, in any procedure for
    actually obtaining it. Furthermore,</p>
    <p>Expressions can be evaluated by a basically simple process
    of substitution and simplification, using both primitive
    <i>rules</i> and <i>rules supplied by the programmer</i> in the
    form of definitions.</p>
    <p>Conceptually this is a set of ordered pairs (or
    relations).</p>
    <p>In the classic (old-school) terms a context is represented
    as an <code>alist</code> or a <i>list of pairs</i>.</p>
