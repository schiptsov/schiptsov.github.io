    <p>#+TITLE Abstract Data Types</p>
    <p>This is by far the most important concept (and related
    methodology) in programming.</p>
    <p>This is a fundamental result, originally by <i>Barbara
    Liskov</i> (for which she received the Turing Award).</p>
    <p>What she did, however, is <i>clearly articulated and grouped
    together</i> related concepts, while the original totions came
    from abstract mathematics.</p>
    <p>The first well-known <i>Abstract Data Type</i>, so to speak,
    is what underlies the <i>Set Theory</i> - the formalized notion
    of a <i>Set</i>.</p>
    <p>Abstract mathematics in general deliberately ignored
    (abstracted out) any notions of <i>actual representation</i> or
    even <i>possible existence</i> of abstract “objects” it
    considers.</p>
    <p>To formalize notions form a Domain in pure mathematics first
    (using Sets and Logic) is an excellent strategy, and this is
    what any serious programmers of the Golden Age (70s, 80s)
    advocate.</p>
    <p>However, classic mathematics is <i>untyped</i> or
    <i>implicitly weakly typed</i>, which means that <i>the
    properties</i> which constitute an abstract structure, or a
    <i>whole family (or a class)</i> of such structures, while
    stated precisely and formally, do not constitute a formal
    definition of a particular type (<i>ADTs</i> and
    <i>Type-classes</i> of Wadler are attempts to do typing
    systemically).</p>
    <p>The abstract notion of a Set is defined <i>only</i> in terms
    of <i>operations</i> (which itself is a set of
    <i>operators</i>), deliberately leaving out everything
    else.</p>
    <p>This is the same principle underlies any proper ADT - it is
    defined in terms of operations on the corresponding Set of
    <i>values</i> (which can be seen as an abstract
    <i>partition</i> on a Universe of all possible values).</p>
    <p>So <i>ADTs are Sets of values</i>, but defined (<i>such
    that</i>) in terms of <i>operations</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Type-classes</i> extends this notion with <i>nesting</i>
    and <i>extension</i> or <i>specialization</i> by defining a Set
    of required <i>interfaces</i> to be implemented. It thus
    formalizes the notion of a <i>Duck-typing</i>.</p>
    <p>To be a <i>duck</i> is to exhibit this and that behavior -
    to quack like a duck and walk like a duck.</p>
    <p>The principle behind Abstract Data Types is clear and
    well-defined separation of</p>
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>A <i>Public Interface</i> (corresponds to a
      <i>signature</i> in ML)</li>
      <li>An <i>Internal representations</i>, together with a
      well-defined <i>representation invariants</i> and other
      <i>constraints</i>.</li>
      <li>A “concrete” <i>Data-Structure</i> which underlay the
      type and <i>actual implementation of corresponding
      algorithms</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Representation and implementation are defined in
    <i>structures</i> in ML.</p>
    <p><i>Data dominates</i> (another fundamental principle) which
    means that once a particular data structure is selected, all
    the algorithms and even the shape of the code (implementation)
    <i>follows</i> - a recursive nature of a data structure implies
    recursive functions that traverse them.</p>
    <p>Similarly, a <i>sum-type</i> dictates its
    <i>pattern-matching code</i> and overall shape of the functions
    which manipulate values of a type.</p>
    <p>Monads in Haskell are ADTs, defined as a class of types (a
    type-class), while each particular <i>instance</i> is precisely
    an ADT.</p>
    <p>The type-class itself is just a <i>named set of
    interfaces</i> together with a <i>class-subclass relation</i>
    (or nesting). Semantics of a <i>type-class</i> is to state
    <i>what it takes to be an <code>X</code></i> - which particular
    <i>signatures</i> must be implemented (by an ADT)</p>
    <p>The second most fundamental concept of <i>Modules</i> is one
    level higher. A <i>Module</i> could contain one or more
    signatures and corresponding structures. In ML these could be
    separated in a .mli and .ml files.</p>
    <p>In ML <i>Modules</i> are high-level abstractions and could
    be <i>applied to one another</i> to produce a “specialized”
    <i>structure</i> (which is another new module).</p>
    <p>This application is based on the mathematical concept of a
    <code>Functor</code> which is a <i>mapping that preserves the
    structure of an “object”</i> (originally defined on directed
    graphs).</p>
