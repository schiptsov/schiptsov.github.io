<h1 class="title">Continuous Learning</h1>
</header><p>
There is a fundamental difference between observing and actual learning by
doing. Yes, merely observing may give ideas and even insights, but only practice
makes an actual change in abilities. This is the wisdom behind the famous (and
probably fake) Bruce Lee quote &ldquo;Knowing is not enough. We must do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Observing someone playing a cello, or painting a portrait is the best examples.
Another obvious example is observing a Moto Grand Prix and actually driving a
bike even at a modest speed. Watching Muay Thai videos will not make you a
fighter.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, when one observes a football game from an elevated spot it
looks very different from the point of view of each actual palyer, who controls
a ball perhaps a few seconds before passing it along. They also see the field
very and fundamentally different. From the above it seems that whole patterns
move across it, while in reality the individual behavior of each player is
almost independent &#x2013; it is the mind of an external observer that <i>creates</i> the
pattern it observes.
</p>

<p>
The most fundamental principle is that <i>stories</i> and even <i>observations</i> are
different from actual experiences of the doers. This is why there is so much
bullshit and confusion about everything. We mistake stories and observations
for what is actually going on.
</p>

<p>
In software the action is in self-control, the ability disentangle and dissect
actual real-world problems to create <i>optimal abstractions</i> and a layered
hierarchical structure which represents a set of interacting parts (processes).
What they post on YouTube about Nodejs, or React or Rust is just bullshit.
</p>

<p>
When people have the right understanding (adequate representation of reality
inside their heads) the great products emerge. The C programming language, and
especially Erlang emerged form telecoms, which solve real physical constraints.
Smalltalk has been envisioned by a trained biologist, early LISPs have been
influenced by emergent biological science (the discovery of the structure of DNA).
</p>

<p>
In sort, a knowledge is to have an accurate inner <i>map of the territory</i> and this
&ldquo;map&rdquo; is constantly reshaped and  maintained <i>by actual doing</i>, by being a doer,
not a mere idle observer.

<p>
<i>To see &ldquo;things&rdquo; as they are</i> is, arguably, the single most important
principle of Buddhism and early Upanishads.
</p>

<p>
This is a conscious regular effort which must become a habit - <i>question
and explain everything to yourself</i>.

<h2 id="org3a9208e">Jigsaw Puzzle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3a9208e">
<p>
A partially solved <i>Jigsaw puzzle</i> is the best (less wrong) metaphor. It
means <i>no contradictions</i> and <i>multiple causality</i>.
</p>

<p>
It also means building up on <i>stable intermediate forms</i> (previous results).
</p>

<p>
The problem is that the <i>jigsaw puzzle</i> has many <i>dimensions</i> and a <i>depth</i>
and <i>nesting</i> (layers of complexity) on each of those.
</p>

<p>
One maintains a constantly updated (and constantly decaying) inner
representation of the environment (the World) in one&rsquo;s brain.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is in the <i>structure</i> and in <i>&ldquo;weights&rdquo;</i> (individual neuron&rsquo;s <i>states</i>).
</p>

<p>
(a partial map, a picture with missed pieces)
</p>

<p>
Connect (relate) with what is <i>already known</i> (already on the &ldquo;map&rdquo;) and
check for <i>contradictions</i>. Reject everything which contradicts with <i>What Is</i>.

Reduce to the underlying principles and build up again.

<p>
All religions are nothing but <i>social conditioning</i>, which is based on a
<i>language</i> and <i>abstract concepts</i>, which, in turn, is just <i>supervised
learning</i> and then <i>reinforcement learning</i> (which is a universal process
in biology).
</p>

<p>
An evolved and genetically transmuted <i>particular structure</i> -
the &ldquo;language area&rdquo; in the brain is a required <i>machinery</i>. Thinking in
terms of language (concepts) and <i>introspection</i> of this process of
thinking are also required to create a complete illusion (or Maya).
</p>

<p>
This is, roughly, how one does it.
