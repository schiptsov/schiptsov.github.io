This is an artifact form the golden age of computer tech.
</p>

<p>
This is a rare example of an <i>evolved</i> (via user&rsquo;s feedback and demands)
software system, which has been built with rational minimalism in user
interface, reliability of underlying math engine, and utmost attention
to details.
</p>

<p>
Some considered this being <i>the</i> killer app, for which users purchased a
very costly PC. Yes, a whole 2-3k USD PC to run just Lotus 1-2-3 for
DOS.
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t even know how to compare this masterpiece with modern crap.
</p>

<p>
It is important to realize that this spreadsheet software is by no
means a toy or somehow inferior in any aspect. Some organizations are
still using it to this day - it just works as intended.
</p>

<p>
Lets say that the full installation of 1-2-3 suite is less than fucking
<code>npm</code>, or <code>cargo</code>, excluding dependencies (while everything is included
in the <code>12MB</code> (<i>megabytes</i>) of the lotus full installation).
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t even want to continue this writing. It makes me sick.
</p>

<p>
Just find the diskette images on some <i>abandonware</i> site, install and
use it. This is still <i>the killer app</i> for so called <i>retro-computing</i>.
</p>

<p>
One could even buy a dedicated cheap DOS PC or a vintage laptop to run the stuff.
</p>

<p>
It literally brings back joy and awe we used to have back then in early
90s.
</p>

<p>
And yes, when one watches some crappy facebook videos about some
Japanese craftsmen obsessed with details and every single move of a
brush or a chisel - think of this lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet software for
DOS. They are of the same quality of craftsmanship.
