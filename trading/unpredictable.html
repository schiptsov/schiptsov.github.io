      <h2 id="orgcc2fbec">A mystical religious sect</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcc2fbec">
        <p>It took years for me to realize that certain areas of
        mathematical statistics are essentially no different in
        organization and nature that those who “scientifically
        study” Tibetan Tantras or similar subjects.</p>
        <p>The whole fields consist mostly on repeating that
        someone said or published before them without any
        connection to actual reality whatsoever. They even proudly
        asknowledge that even if unapplicable, their theories are
        “sound”.</p>
        <p>They just continue pile up abstract bullshit about
        abstract entities from their books - exactly what Tantric
        “scholars” do.</p>
        <p>Reality checks, however, show that not a single
        sophisticated million-dollar cost statistical model
        outperformed the Market, and the profits institutions post
        are due to manipulations and primitive risky bets.</p>
        <p>Like any good Tantric doctrine, so called
        <i>risk-management</i> in speculative financial and
        especially crypto markets is just <i>highly sophisticated
        sectarian bullshit</i> full of abstract (which captures
        nothing about reality) integral and differential equations,
        <i>deeply nested</i>.</p>
        <p>Any scientific experimental testing would inevitably
        fail to validate any probabilistic model which is supposed
        to be able to predict any future outcome in the Market, but
        high social status of a priest of advanced statistics binds
        a sect together.</p>

      <h2 id="org8d25426">Principles</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8d25426">
        <p>There are some notions from the old-school AI which
        tried to model systems.</p>
        <p>A system is <i>fully observable</i> iff all the factors
        which affect it are known and could be defined
        mathematically.</p>
        <p>Any dice or card or a game with a discrete set of
        <i>fully deterministic</i> rules is such a system.</p>
        <p>Any physical system, subject to the finite set of
        “forces” and “laws” is also <i>fully deterministic</i>,
        given that any change in the environment will yield a
        <i>proportional</i> change is its observable behavior.</p>
        <p>As long as a system is <i>fully observable</i> and
        <i>fully deterministic</i> (ether discrete or continuous)
        and mathematically <a href="modeling.html">modeled</a> as
        such, there is well-understood <i>frequentionist</i>
        approach to observe and describe it.</p>
        <p>A system being <i>fully deterministic</i> does not imply
        that it does not fluctuate or have pertubations within. A
        mountain river changes its flow daily, depending on time of
        the day, rains and seasons, but remains <i>fully observable
        and fully deterministic</i>.</p>
        <p>Markets are nothing like that.</p>
        <p>A Market is a <i>dynamic</i> system, defined as
        follows:</p>
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>The factors that affect its observable behavior are
          <i>NOT fully observable</i> or even could be
          enumerated.</li>
          <li><i>New</i> (unseen before) factors continuously
          evolve and never remain stable..</li>
          <li>Observed (modeled) factors <i>change its nature over
          time</i> (do not stay the same).</li>
          <li>The “weights” of observed (modeled) factors <i>change
          over time</i> or even completely disappear.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Market therefore is not a stable system. All the
        models form physics (which model an apriory stable system)
        are fundamentally wrong.</p>
        <p>The ongoing activity of modeling them with probabilistic
        models is just (no different from) a religious sectarian
        activity performing sophisticated, vastly complex and
        costly rituals in minute details.</p>
        <p>Notice that adequately modeling one or many aspects of
        it does not yield anything more than just one particular
        aspect.</p>

      <div id="outline-container-org24836e1" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org24836e1">Measuring “random” perturbations</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org24836e1">
          <p>While sounds reasonable and “logical”, permutations of
          a dynamic system yield only temporary approximations.</p>
          <p>Even measuring cloud formations in a certain mountain
          are would produce a certain bounds about size, frequency
          and thinkness, exactly because there are a finite set of
          physical factors involved.</p>
          <p>Everything is good and “reasonable” until an extremely
          rare cyclone from the sea reaches the area, and suddenly
          all the prior measurements and estimated probabilities
          got fucked (this is a technical term).</p>
          <p>Notice, that these permutations are within some
          bounds, which are determined by the finite set of
          physical constraints on this particular planet
          (determined, in turn, by its size, mass, distance from
          the Sun). These are stable (for us and life itself).</p>
          <p>In modern Markets there are no such stability, which
          implies that perturbations could be <i>unbound</i>.</p>
          <p>The crucial principle is that, unlike physics,
          completely new factors, not limited to sums of exiting or
          observed ones, could be added just the very next minute.
          This fact invalidates any assumptions of stability at the
          right edge of a chart.</p>

      </div>
      <div id="outline-container-org88adfa5" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org88adfa5">Not an opinion</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org88adfa5">
          <p>It is not a matter of opinion, whether the Market
          actions can be consistently predicted. It is a conclusion
          based on grounded on the <i>Causality Principle</i>
          logic.</p>
          <p>Religious sects, however, are rely for their very
          existence on having conflicting, clashing opinions, while
          not a single one could be <i>proven</i> correct. This is
          precisely what is going on.</p>
          <p>Again, religious phenomena are well-understood and
          demonstrably reducible to <i>supervised learning</i> on
          socially conditioned inputs. There is literally noting
          but a supervised and then reinforcement learning.</p>

      <h2 id="org35e327b">Unpredictable</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35e327b">
        <p>The fact that a large number of participants, including
        institutions and exchanges, with different anticipations
        and conflicting interests are simultaneously present in the
        Market makes it <i>unpredictable</i>.</p>
        <p>This implies that we should not even look towards
        possibility of a consistent predictions, and focus on
        reactive side, just like every biological system has been
        evolved to do.</p>
        <p>Biological systems, including us, rely on quick and
        dirty hard-wired heurisitcs, which reflect the constraints
        of <i>stable</i> physical environment, which looks like a
        universal stable strategy, evolved independently every
        time.</p>
        <p>Yes, I would miss a $200k position of stats wizard at a
        Wall Street hedge fund (destined to inevitably collapse
        with a next major market crash), but the truth is
        dearest.</p>
        <p>I will write a simple trading assistant which reacts
        adequately to <i>What Is</i>.</p>
        <p>And yes, any unsupervised learning will fail <i>in
        principle</i>, because it <i>requires</i> a stable
        structure of underlying physical reality (learning just one
        or two aspects won’t do).</p>
