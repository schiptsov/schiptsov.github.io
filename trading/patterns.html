<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcac803e">
<p>
Patterns <i>on a chart</i> exist for exactly the same reason religious or
sacred symbols exist - because other people <i>think</i> so. Other people
<i>caused</i> them to appear, no more, no less.
</p>

<p>
The patterns are <i>socially constructed</i>, the same way religious symbols
and rituals are. In the same way they are <i>self-reinforcing</i>.

<h2 id="org67fd71a">TA</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org67fd71a">
<p>
So called <code>TA</code> or <i>Technical Analysis</i> is a teaching (similar to
sectarian ones), according to which certain patterns on a chart
<i>predict</i> certain outcomes within the Market.
</p>

<p>
The more people are familiar with <code>TA</code>, the more their prophesies are
self-fulfilling. Just like religious rites, everything reinforces itself
with actions of the practitioners.
</p>

<p>
Market movements and price actions are not random. There is no such thing as randomness (which is an abstract mathematical concept) in the first place. All the price actions are results of actions of all participating agents, who have certain beliefs and assumptions (in their heads or programmed into trading bots).
</p>

<p>
The future is not predictable in principle (and predictions are mostly
wrong), however, <i>reacting</i> to certain events or patterns with (or <i>against</i>) other market participants makes actions meaningful or even <i>profitable</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is what <code>TA</code> is.

<h2 id="org8b91fd0">Recurring patterns emerge from chaos</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8b91fd0">
<p>
This is a <i>less wrong</i> view of Reality. Other people are looking for
well-known patterns, so they eventually emerge from chaos as
results of <i>amplified</i> and <i>self-reinforced</i> actions of the crowds of
market participants - idiots are FOMOing in, etc.
</p>

<p>
There is literally nothing else in it - just large crowds of emotional
people acting <i>out of sync</i>.
