      <h2 id="org2c03d26">Time in US and East-Asian timezones</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2c03d26"></div>

        <h3 id="org32fa68b">Mornings</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org32fa68b">
          <p>The morning is psychologically significant. People are
          fresh, full of energy and unwarranted optimism. They
          check <i>pre-market</i> charts and news and are ready to
          make over-confident, emotional decisions.</p>
          <p>Major moves happen when Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan
          and South Korea wakes up.</p>
          <p>However the biggest moves are when the US wakes up, NY
          in particular.</p>

      <div id="outline-container-org4bad3dd" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org4bad3dd">Nights</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4bad3dd">
          <p>Nights are also special. People are stressed,
          exhausted, without focus and readily make stupid,
          emotional decisions, usually on a safe side. I personally
          have closed uncountable number of strategic
          positions.</p>
          <p>Overwhelming stress makes people (and animals) seek
          safety, and this is just an evolved safety mechanism at
          neurological level. Most people cannot control this,
          leave alone override.</p>

    <div id="outline-container-org036e8fd" class="outline-2">
      <h2 id="org036e8fd">Opening of the US stock market</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org036e8fd">
        <p>The opening of the US stock market is the most
        significant event of every day. By that time hordes of
        professional Wall Street traders are already fully
        caffeinated, cocained and psyoped by screaming financial
        news and hysterical social media.</p>
        <p><i>The first hour</i> after opening defines the day
        ahead, unless, of course, some unexpected news hit the
        market. Most of ordinary events are <i>anticipated</i> and
        this is the meaning of the “priced in” meme.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="outline-container-orgca6dace" class="outline-2">
      <h2 id="orgca6dace">and its closing</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgca6dace">
        <p>Majority of floor and retail traders do not leave risky
        potions overnight - they liquidate them, both longs and
        shorts, before the bell. Imagine, there is suddenly no
        buyers for your bags. Nightmare.</p>
        <p>This is why professionals who trade US stock market
        (against retail, of course) are particularly active right
        before the closing time, usually after a day’s break (to
        either side).</p>
        <p>Crypto makers are of course 24/365, but there is way
        less activity (in terms of market orders and volume) after
        closing. Again, the US time is the most important.</p>
        <p>So, if you cannot be aware and focused at these times
        you probably should not trade at all, because you will miss
        most of major moves.</p>

    <div id="outline-container-org7c322bf" class="outline-2">
      <h2 id="org7c322bf">US macro events</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c322bf">
        <p>Periodical releases of economic data by major US
        agencies are among the most important macro events. Fed
        meetings and public speeches of its officials are important
        too.</p>
        <p>All these evens have any significance exactly because
        lots of people consider them as important. There are a few
        different sects which has a secret knowledge how to
        interpret the messages and predict further Market moves.
        Does not work most of the time, but secret doctrines are
        not supposed to.</p>
        <p>One have to know <i>the key dates of the month</i> and
        time and be awake and alert. These events move the Market
        because other people make their quick and stupid decisions
        right during the events or the very next minute after the
        numbers has been released.</p>
        <p>Notice that Europe is almost irrelevant. Russia has much
        bigger significance because it runs and trades all the
        major <i>crypto scams</i>.</p>
