<div id="outline-container-org1b4271e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1b4271e">Time in US and East-Asian timezones</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1b4271e">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org26028ea" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org26028ea">Mornings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org26028ea">
<p>
The morning is psychologically significant. People are fresh, full of
energy and unwarranted optimism. They check <i>pre-market</i> charts and news
and are ready to make over-confident, emotional decisions.
</p>

<p>
Major moves happen when Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan and South Korea
wakes up.
</p>

<p>
However the biggest moves are when the US wakes up, NY in particular.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9c4bc75" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9c4bc75">Nights</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c4bc75">
<p>
Nights are also special. People are stressed, exhausted, without focus
and readily make stupid, emotional decisions, usually on a safe side. I
personally have closed uncountable number of strategic positions.
</p>

<p>
Overwhelming stress makes people (and animals) seek safety, and this is
just an evolved safety mechanism at neurological level. Most people
cannot control this, leave alone override.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0f737bc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0f737bc">Opening of the US stock market</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0f737bc">
<p>
The opening of the US stock market is the most significant event of
every day. By that time hordes of professional Wall Street traders are
already fully caffeinated, cocained and psyoped by screaming financial
news and hysterical social media.
</p>

<p>
<i>The first hour</i> after opening defines the day ahead, unless, of course,
some unexpected news hit the market. Most of ordinary events are
<i>anticipated</i> and this is the meaning of the &ldquo;priced in&rdquo; meme.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgdf31fa4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdf31fa4">and its closing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdf31fa4">
<p>
Majority of floor and retail traders do not leave risky potions
overnight - they liquidate them, both longs and shorts, before the bell.
Imagine, there is suddenly no buyers for your bags. Nightmare.
</p>

<p>
This is why professionals who trade US stock market (against retail,
of course) are particularly active right before the closing time, usually
after a day&rsquo;s break (to either side).
</p>

<p>
Crypto makers are of course 24/365, but there is way less activity (in terms
of market orders and volume) after closing. Again, the US time is the most important.
</p>

<p>
So, if you cannot be aware and focused at these times you probably
should not trade at all, because you will miss most of major moves.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgad1ac68" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgad1ac68">US macro events</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgad1ac68">
<p>
Periodical releases of economic data by major US agencies are among
the most important macro events. Fed meetings and public speeches of its
officials are important too.
</p>

<p>
All these evens have any significance exactly because lots of people
consider them as important. There are a few different sects which has a
secret knowledge how to interpret the messages and predict further
Market moves. Does not work most of the time, but secret doctrines are
not supposed to.
</p>

<p>
One have to know <i>the key dates of the month</i> and time and be awake and
alert. These events move the Market because other people make their
quick and stupid decisions right during the events or the very next
minute after the numbers has been released.
</p>

<p>
Notice that Europe is almost irrelevant. Russia has much bigger significance
because it runs and trades all the major <i>crypto scams</i>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb81700b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb81700b">Minor but real factors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb81700b">
<p>
The end of a <i>hourly</i> candle is consistent minor factor - it coincide
with ends of all the divisors of 60, so a lot of people watching
<i>differnt</i> timelines will see a <i>beginning of a new candle</i>.
</p>

<p>
People who are previously <i>stood aside</i> (not holding any position but
wishing to) usual decide to jump in at these &ldquo;new beginnings&rdquo;.
