    <p>Quick explanations for some common trading memes.</p>
    <div id="outline-container-org4e00faa" class="outline-2">
      <h2 id="org4e00faa">Priced in</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4e00faa">
        <p>This means that a particular upcoming event is being
        understood and anticipated by the most trades and is
        contrasted with an unexpected, surprise or “shocking” event
        (news).</p>
        <p>“Priced in” usually refers to a monthly release of US
        macro-economic data, such as <code>CPI</code> or to FED
        actions, such as rate-hike announcements.</p>
        <p>98% of the time, however, this meme is used by retards
        arbitrary for almost anything.</p>

    <div id="outline-container-org6263f52" class="outline-2">
      <h2 id="org6263f52">The bottom is in</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6263f52">
        <p>This is being said about every single upward reversal
        (sucker’s rally) in an established <i>bear marker</i>.</p>
        <p>Retards believe that the price must go up again as it
        did in the previous <i>bull run</i>, which is still fresh
        and emotionally charged in their memories, and consider the
        current bear market as a temporary slump before a take off
        to ze moon.</p>
        <p>Of course, every bear marker has been caused by certain
        marco-economic and related social factors and the causation
        must be analyzed.</p>
        <p>Jumping onto each shallow reversal is a losing strategy.
        The real major reversal is always caused, again, by major
        macro or social factors, not just a bunch of
        over-enthusiastic degens buying every minor <i>higher
        low</i>.</p>
