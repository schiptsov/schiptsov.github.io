</header><p>
Bear market rallies are sudden and violent, since everyone is FOMOing in
on an unsubstantiated hopium and gut feeling that everything gonna be
all right.
</p>

<p>
Some hot meme is also required. This time the meme is &ldquo;the Fed&rsquo;s pivot&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The bottom is in! It is in the air, lmao. A &ldquo;meltup&rdquo;. Who cares about
actual situation?
</p>

<p>
This is how hopium and wishful thinking of literal degenerates distort
reality and pump markets. We got these so called &ldquo;bear market rallies&rdquo; which spooked
everyone who is trying to think rationally according to an imperfect
information about what is actually going on in the world.
</p>

<p>
And this is why &ldquo;buy the dip&rdquo; meme is a valid one - a &ldquo;bear market
rally&rdquo; could erupt at any moment because it is based on feelings and
wishful thinking of a large, primitive crowd. It is just a <i>cascade</i> or a
chain reaction, an irrational <i>bullish exuberance</i>, which is very real
nevertheless and the prices are going parabolic out of nothing.
</p>

<p>
This is when <i>badly timed shorts</i> (too late) get <i>stopped out</i> or even liquidated for
literally nothing except this <i>irrational exuberance</i>.
</p>

<p>
Nothing has been solved in EU. UK PM&rsquo;s financial decisions are just
gambling. The war is about to escalate. The UN&rsquo;s demand to stop hiking
is bullshit - better to do something about <i>the actual cause</i> of this
recession instead. No reason for a pump like this.
</p>

<p>
But it pumps because everyone <i>wishes</i> for a pump.
