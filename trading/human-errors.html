        <p>This is the major factor of loses. Small loses due to
        negligence, stress and mood swings accumulate very quickly
        and suddenly your <i>trading account</i> is empty
        again.</p>

        <h3 id="org4443ed9">Bad timing</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4443ed9">
          <p>The most common errors are of <i>bad timing</i></p>
          <ul class="org-ul">
            <li>not acting quickly enough (the spot moves away from
            a <i>wick</i>, so your <i>stop-loss</i> will be too far
            away and you will lose more)</li>
            <li>acting emotionally too soon (a <i>re-entry</i> into
            the same direction after being <i>stopped-out</i> -
            against contining trend, only to be <i>stopped-out</i>
            again).</li>

        <h3 id="org354e7bc">Demoralized</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org354e7bc">
          <p>Quick, unexpected bounces (shallow reversals) are
          annoying and demoralizing so one loses motivation and
          focus. However, these swings also good opportunities for
          an entry in the right direction. Missing them only adds
          to stress and despair.</p>
          <p>One should understand the stress and desperation of
          the losing party (bulls in an established bear market,
          lets say) and to avoid <i>emotional contagion</i>, which
          is very real, and to avoid doing emotional shit.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="outline-container-org5c0cc56" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org5c0cc56">Neglect</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c0cc56">
          <p>Sometimes we don’t feel like sticking to a strict
          discipline and want to <i>improvise</i> and to try
          something different. There is no worse thing that
          improvisation, especially if you don’t know how to play
          serious music.</p>
          <p>Lots of loses happened because you are trying
          something instead of sticking to a <i>simple</i> rigorous
          system (only simple systems work
          <i>consistently</i>).</p>
          <p>One might increase a position size on a whim, or,
          which is worse, to close a position due to
          <i>intution</i> or <i>feeling</i> while its stop-loss, it
          runts out, will not be reached. Closing a strategic
          position is a loss.</p>
          <p><i>Don’t try to improvise</i> is the second best
          advice, just after “don’t do emotional shit”.</p>

        <h3 id="orgddc21d7">Urge to enter</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgddc21d7">
          <p>This is similar in nature to a gambler’s urge to place
          a bet. The difference between a gambler (and an
          inevitable, serial looser) and a trader is that trader
          must resist the urge to open an arbitrary position (in
          the middle of a range).</p>
          <p>Positions shall be opened only at
          <i>probabilistic-favorable</i> (even slightly) conditions
          - within an emergent <i>pattern</i>, giving that other
          market condition has been read and interpreted
          adequately.</p>
          <p>An arbitrary position in any direction is a guaranteed
          loss (will be stopped-out due to <i>local
          volatility</i>). It is not a naive notion of
          <code>0.5</code> chance, it is almost <code>0.9</code>
          that the price will swing higher <i>and</i> lower
          (back-and-forth) <i>within a flat range</i>.</p>
