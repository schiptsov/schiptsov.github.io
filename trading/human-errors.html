<h2 id="org9e79920">Lack of strict discipline</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9e79920">
<p>
This is the major factor of loses. Small loses due to negligence, stress
and mood swings accumulate very quickly and suddenly your <i>trading
account</i> is empty again.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7ba5448" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7ba5448">Bad timing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7ba5448">
<p>
The most common errors are of <i>bad timing</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>not acting quickly enough (the spot moves away from a <i>wick</i>, so your
<i>stop-loss</i> will be too far away and you will lose more)</li>
<li>acting emotionally too soon (a <i>re-entry</i> into the same direction
after being <i>stopped-out</i> - against contining trend, only to be
<i>stopped-out</i> again).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfcab642" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfcab642">Demoralized</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfcab642">
<p>
Quick, unexpected bounces (shallow reversals) are annoying and
demoralizing so one loses motivation and focus. However, these swings
also good opportunities for an entry in the right direction. Missing
them only adds to stress and despair.
</p>

<p>
One should understand the stress and desperation of the losing party
(bulls in an established bear market, lets say) and to avoid <i>emotional
contagion</i>, which is very real, and to avoid doing emotional shit.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9151520" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9151520">Neglect</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9151520">
<p>
Sometimes we don&rsquo;t feel like sticking to a strict discipline and want to
<i>improvise</i> and to try something different. There is no worse thing that
improvisation, especially if you don&rsquo;t know how to play serious music.
</p>

<p>
Lots of loses happened because you are trying something instead of
sticking to a <i>simple</i> rigorous system (only simple systems work
<i>consistently</i>).
</p>

<p>
One might increase a position size on a whim, or, which is worse, to
close a position due to <i>intution</i> or <i>feeling</i> while its stop-loss, it
runts out, will not be reached. Closing a strategic position is a loss.
</p>

<p>
<i>Don&rsquo;t try to improvise</i> is the second best advice, just after &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do
emotional shit&rdquo;.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf5e612f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf5e612f">Urge to enter</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf5e612f">
<p>
This is similar in nature to a gambler&rsquo;s urge to place a bet. The
difference between a gambler (and an inevitable, serial looser) and a
trader is that trader must resist the urge to open an arbitrary position
(in the middle of a range).
</p>

<p>
Positions shall be opened only at <i>probabilistic-favorable</i> (even
slightly) conditions - within an emergent <i>pattern</i>, giving that other
market condition has been read and interpreted adequately.
</p>

<p>
An arbitrary position in any direction is a guaranteed loss (will be
stopped-out due to <i>local volatility</i>). It is not a naive notion of
<code>0.5</code> chance, it is almost <code>0.9</code> that the price will swing higher <i>and</i>
lower (back-and-forth) <i>within a flat range</i>.
