          <p><code>Bitcoin</code> as a phenomenon has many aspects
          in it, but it has been “evolved” into a <i>speculative
          asset</i> (interment meme socks to get rich quickly) and
          an internet <i>collectible</i> - digital baseball cards,
          if you wish.</p>

          (in-house trading desks), by exchanges and “whales”,

          finance and math literates.</p>
          <p><code>BTC</code> is <i>The</i> crypto. It is a blue
          chip internet meme token - a risky asset to be traded in
          an emergent industry of exchanges offering sophisticated

      <h2 id="org3d1def0">Notes</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3d1def0">
        <p>Bitcoin went to almost 70k not because of some stupid
        logarithmic scale graph or some maximalist
        bullshitting.</p>
        <p>It went parabolic because of <code>Covid</code> when
        suddenly, hundreds of millions of people found themselves
        without a stable income and with lots of time at hand.</p>
        <p>Stimmy checks by US and EU governments were also a major
        contribution (crucial factors). Money went from govt to
        Joes and Jeens and then to stocks and crypto.</p>
        <p>Everyone suddenly became an “investor” or at least a
        gambler, and ’’these factors’’, along with easy
        availability of “exchanges”, send the prices to $70k.</p>
        <p>All other abstract theories and explanations are
        bullshit. And no, the event like <code>Covid</code> was not
        anticipated or modeled anywhere.</p>
        <p>Again, evolving systems are unpredictable by its past
        performance. They are unfolding based on “fresh set” of new
        multiple causality. Each new event contributes (changes the
        representation) to a new view (map) of reality.</p>
        <p>Forecasting is just a sectarian bullshit.</p>
        <p>Markets are driven by human actions and emotions, not
        some abstract models, no matter how sophisticated.
        Individual metrics and indicators are just superimposed
        upon a graph by human minds. They are the <i>second
        causes</i> (people are acting upon them) but not the
        primary ones.</p>
        <p><code>Dogecoin</code> or <code>SHIB</code> performance,
        scams like <code>Chainlink</code> are proofs of inadequacy
        of any current (and further) models.</p>
        <p>“19/05/2021” Scams like Doge and Chainlink performed
        exactly as BTC. There in no other factors but memes.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="outline-container-orgd9283e8" class="outline-3">

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd9283e8">
          <p>A well-thought and probably mathematically modeled
          beforehand system. Definitely designed by a math-nerd,
          MIT style.</p>
          <p>The tech is solid, but it will never be a “currency”
          which is a biggest meme, and will never had any
          “adoption” (ATMs and exchanges are the only
          adoption).</p>
          <p>The cost of mining (adding new blocks to the chain)
          will eventually transform it into mere “digital
          souvenirs”.</p>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0d71fd6">
          <p>An “I could do it too” bullshit, designed by an
          ambitious, narcissistic youngster without any adequate
          mathematical or technical background. Just naive wishful
          thinning. A few basic concepts (a state machine, VM,
          blockchain) put together without any understanding.</p>
          <p>Had lots of developer’s attention, <i>a lot of
          enthusiasm and momentum</i>, and naive elitism (still the
          major driving force), however, poor design and technical
          dept will ruin it.</p>
          <p>Any 2.0 memes will fail due to errors, hacks, poor
          code quality (think of some early PHP shit).</p>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2b5f546">
          <p>The definition of a scam and bullshit. Incompetent,
          inadequate CEO, majored in “philosophy” (shitty one,
          Hegelian piles of abstract nonsense) pushing ’’abstract
          solutions’’, which lacks any real demand or even
          implementations.</p>
          <p>The whole idea of being a middle-man (between data
          producers and data consumers), a broker of <i>other
          people’s data</i> is clearly an economical bullshit.</p>
          <p>Technological side is, obviously, neglected and nearly
          non-existent, and amounts to some set of parsers and
          convertors in Javascript (LMAO!) .</p>
          <p>The most important thing that this “projects” is about
          securing founder’s decent living (money in a bank), not
          delivering ’’any’’ solutions. Being funded with
          meme-coins is way more profitable than any actual
          development.</p>
          <p>The shitcoin is centralized, pre-mined, ERC20 token

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4e51a98">
          <p>A corporate scam, similar to Chainlink (the whole
          purpose is a decent living while in the “project”).</p>
          <p>Much better marketed and executed. Got lots of
          technology big names involved (at least on paper).</p>
          <p>The advertised reliance of formal-systems
          (specifications, theorem proving tools, etc.),
          pure-functional languages, peer-reviewed “scientific”
          papers makes it look solid for unsophisticated
          “investors”. This is the main reason for its
          “success”.</p>
          <p>Despite the being affiliated with the brightest people
          in academia, who brought in all the advantages of the
          last 50 years of PL research, the actual implementation
          is crap (an ’’Enterprise Java-like’’ code, but in
          [wiki:/Languages/Haskell Haskell]) and, it seems, does
          not match specifications (which is a major difficulty in
          ’’implementing’’ partially formally defined and partially
          verified system) and this is the cause why there is still
          no working product being delivered).</p>
          <p>Of course, the big guys on the front page do not write
          any actual code, they only publish and review papers,
          give talks and serve on boards.</p>
          <p>Actually, Cardano is by far the best ’’attempt’’, and
          its failure was in becoming “a typical corporation”.</p>

      <div id="outline-container-org9a0307a" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org9a0307a">Tezos</h3>
        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9a0307a">
          <p>Another ambitious attempt, by a gifted programmer. It
          is based on the Ocaml (’’a decent, mostly functional
          language’’ of the ML family) and the guy, allegedly had
          some math background.</p>
          <p>However, the code reveals immaturity and lack of
          understanding of fundamental FP principles -
          <i>Monads</i> are used in strict language (unnecessary,
          redundant abstractions). Other messy (poorly understood)
          abstractions are expected.</p>
          <p>To be fair, it is ok to use <i>monadic composition</i>
          for error handling, but the topic (monads in a strict,
          mostly functional language) is very subtle.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, the code is well-documented,
          well-structured into modules, and is otherwise OK. The
          guy is principle-guided, which is a sign of a better
          developed mind.</p>
          <p>However, this project has no memes, which is
          everything for running a good scam.</p>
