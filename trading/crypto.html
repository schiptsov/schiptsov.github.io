<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4600cb8">
<p>
As long as a system keeps evolving (producing new factors, heuristics, etc.) &rsquo;&rsquo;its past performance is irrelevant&rsquo;&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
Past performance of an evolving system does not predict the future (current performance). This is a law.
</p>

<p>
In short, everything can be explained in terms of human mass psychology.

<h3 id="org167bc4e">BTC</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org167bc4e">
<p>
<code>Bitcoin</code> as a phenomenon has many aspects in it, but it has been
&ldquo;evolved&rdquo; into a <i>speculative asset</i> (interment meme socks to get rich
quickly) and an internet <i>collectible</i> - digital baseball cards, if you
wish.
</p>

<p>
It is traded by <i>pros</i>, by <i>institutions</i> (in-house trading desks), by
exchanges and &ldquo;whales&rdquo;, because the <i>whitepaper</i> has a direct appeal to
finance and math literates.
</p>

<p>
<code>BTC</code> is <i>The</i> crypto. It is a blue chip internet meme token - a risky
asset to be traded in an emergent industry of exchanges offering
sophisticated trading vehicles.

<h3 id="org3c16671">ETH</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3c16671">
<p>
<code>Ethereum</code> is traded by not so smart, common <i>techies</i> who <i>believe</i> in
  genius of fucking Vitaliks and in the tech (which is actually
  outrageous amateur crap).
</p>

<p>
It is loved by delusional russians, who think of it as something very
special and the most clever (which is, obviously, not).
</p>

<p>
<code>ETH</code> is literally <i>PHP of crypto</i> and the only selling point is that it
already works somehow and is everywhere in amateurs &ldquo;projects&rdquo;.
</p>

<h3 id="org9068058">ADA</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9068058">
<p>
IOHK capitalizes on the <i>enterprise</i> meme. It attracts soiboys who did
  some &ldquo;research&rdquo; and fell for the sophisticated buzzwords, and <i>Haskell</i>,
  you know, and really big names (Phil Wadler!) on the &ldquo;abput&rdquo; page.
</p>

<p>
It takes real knowledge to realize that all the actual coding has been
left to hired amateurs and the project is crap (10 transactions per
second).
</p>

<p>
In other words, there is a company who develop crytpro solution for
enterprises (as if it is really in demand).

<p>
<code>Chainlink</code> is traded by utter degenerates, who literally <i>believe</i> and
  <i>have faith</i> in the hundreds of pages of <i>abstract bullshit</i> they
  cannot even comprehend.
</p>

<p>
This is why its price actions are so emotional (a roller coaster) -
 everything is <i>on faith</i> and <i>unshaken belief</i>.
</p>

<p>
The model is of a religious sect or a cult where knowing is impossible
 and believing what is required. Mostly low IQ degens are attracted by
 it.
</p>

<p>
I am sure some <i>pros</i> are secretly trading this shitcoin <i>against the retail</i>
because it is literally a textbook case of volatile emotional market
full of amateur idiots.

<p>
These literal shitcoins are traded by average Joes who never bothered to
do any research and just FOMOing in as everyone around them else does.
</p>

<p>
Smart people short big <i>green candles</i> of mass hysteria and take Joe&rsquo;s
money. I wish I knew this in 2020.

<p>
Bitcoin went to almost 70k not because of some stupid logarithmic scale graph or some maximalist bullshitting.
</p>

<p>
It went parabolic because of <code>Covid</code> when suddenly, hundreds of millions of people found themselves without a stable income and with lots of time at hand.
</p>

<p>
Stimmy checks by US and EU governments were also a major contribution
(crucial factors). Money went from govt to Joes and Jeens and then to
stocks and crypto.
</p>

<p>
Everyone suddenly became an &ldquo;investor&rdquo; or at least a gambler, and &rsquo;&rsquo;these factors&rsquo;&rsquo;, along with easy availability of &ldquo;exchanges&rdquo;, send the prices to $70k.
</p>

<p>
All other abstract theories and explanations are bullshit. And no, the
event like <code>Covid</code> was not anticipated or modeled anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Again, evolving systems are unpredictable by its past performance. They are unfolding based on &ldquo;fresh set&rdquo; of new multiple causality. Each new event contributes (changes the representation) to a new view (map) of reality.
</p>

<p>
Forecasting is just a sectarian bullshit.
</p>

<p>
Markets are driven by human actions and emotions, not some abstract
models, no matter how sophisticated. Individual metrics and indicators
are just superimposed upon a graph by human minds. They are the <i>second
causes</i> (people are acting upon them) but not the primary ones.
</p>

<p>
<code>Dogecoin</code> or <code>SHIB</code> performance, scams like <code>Chainlink</code> are proofs of inadequacy of any current (and further) models.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;19/05/2021&rdquo; Scams like Doge and Chainlink performed exactly as BTC. There in no other factors but memes. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org78688a6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org78688a6">BTC</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78688a6">
<p>
A well-thought and probably mathematically modeled beforehand system. Definitely designed by a math-nerd, MIT style.
</p>

<p>
The tech is solid, but it will never be a &ldquo;currency&rdquo; which is a biggest
meme, and will never had any &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; (ATMs and exchanges are the only adoption).
</p>

<p>
The cost of mining (adding new blocks to the chain) will eventually transform it into mere &ldquo;digital souvenirs&rdquo;.

<div id="outline-container-org73accf8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org73accf8">ETH</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org73accf8">
<p>
An &ldquo;I could do it too&rdquo; bullshit, designed by an ambitious, narcissistic
youngster without any adequate mathematical or technical background.
Just naive wishful thinning. A few basic concepts (a state machine, VM,
blockchain) put together without any understanding.
</p>

<p>
Had lots of developer&rsquo;s attention, <i>a lot of enthusiasm and momentum</i>,
 and naive elitism (still the major driving force), however, poor design
 and technical dept will ruin it.
</p>

<p>
Any 2.0 memes will fail due to errors, hacks, poor code quality (think of some early PHP shit).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge697888" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge697888">LINK</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge697888">
<p>
The definition of a scam and bullshit. Incompetent, inadequate CEO,
majored in &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; (shitty one, Hegelian piles of abstract
nonsense) pushing &rsquo;&rsquo;abstract solutions&rsquo;&rsquo;, which lacks any real demand or
even implementations.
</p>

<p>
The whole idea of being a middle-man (between data producers and data
consumers), a broker of <i>other people&rsquo;s data</i> is clearly an economical
bullshit.
</p>

<p>
Technological side is, obviously, neglected and nearly non-existent, and amounts to some set of parsers and convertors in Javascript (LMAO!) .
</p>

<p>
The most important thing that this &ldquo;projects&rdquo; is about securing founder&rsquo;s decent living (money in a bank), not delivering &rsquo;&rsquo;any&rsquo;&rsquo; solutions. Being funded with meme-coins is way more profitable than any actual development.
</p>

<p>
The shitcoin is centralized, pre-mined, ERC20 token (lmao) being sold to exchanges.

<h3 id="org7e89e39">ADA</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7e89e39">
<p>
A corporate scam, similar to Chainlink (the whole purpose is a decent living while in the &ldquo;project&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
Much better marketed and executed. Got lots of technology big names involved (at least on paper).
</p>

<p>
The advertised reliance of formal-systems (specifications, theorem proving tools, etc.), pure-functional languages, peer-reviewed &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; papers makes it look solid for unsophisticated &ldquo;investors&rdquo;. This is the main reason for its &ldquo;success&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Despite the being affiliated with the brightest people in academia, who brought in all the advantages of the last 50 years of PL research, the actual implementation is crap (an &rsquo;&rsquo;Enterprise Java-like&rsquo;&rsquo; code, but in [wiki:/Languages/Haskell Haskell]) and, it seems, does not match specifications (which is a major difficulty in &rsquo;&rsquo;implementing&rsquo;&rsquo; partially formally defined and partially verified system) and this is the cause why there is still no working product being delivered).
</p>

<p>
Of course, the big guys on the front page do not write any actual code, they only publish and review papers, give talks and serve on boards.
</p>

<p>
Actually, Cardano is by far the best &rsquo;&rsquo;attempt&rsquo;&rsquo;, and its failure was in becoming &ldquo;a typical corporation&rdquo;.

<h3 id="org9021f41">Tezos</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9021f41">
<p>
Another ambitious attempt, by a gifted programmer. It is based on the
Ocaml (&rsquo;&rsquo;a decent, mostly functional language&rsquo;&rsquo; of the ML family) and the guy, allegedly had some math background.
</p>

<p>
However, the code reveals immaturity and lack of understanding of fundamental FP principles - <i>Monads</i> are used in strict language (unnecessary, redundant abstractions). Other messy (poorly understood) abstractions are expected.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, it is ok to use <i>monadic composition</i> for error handling,
but the topic (monads in a strict, mostly functional language) is
very subtle.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, the code is well-documented, well-structured into modules, and is otherwise OK. The guy is principle-guided, which is a sign of a better developed mind.
</p>

<p>
However, this project has no memes, which is everything for running a good scam.
