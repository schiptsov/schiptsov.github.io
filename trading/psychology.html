<h1 class="title">Psychology</h1>
</header><p>
Trading is a social <i>process</i> (governed by <i>social psychology</i>), NOT mathematics or sophisticated models.
</p>

<p>
A <i>market</i> is a mess made by literally <i>millions</i> of people, just like politics, sports and societies in general.
</p>

<p>
People are driven by <i>emotions</i>, NOT cold rationality. Most of them even are incapable of being rational, which requires certain skills.
</p>

<p>
This implies that the main driving force is the dumb majority (just as in everything <i>social</i>) and their strong emotions of <i>greed</i> and <i>fear</i>, their knee-jerk reactions, their <i>habits</i> and their <i>social conditioning</i>.
</p>

<p>
One does not have to prove to himself that he is right and they are wrong. (They <i>are</i> wrong, but there are way too many of them).
</p>

<p>
One has to ride the <i>emerging</i> market <i>currents</i> and <i>waves</i> (and see them <i>as
they are</i>) without going against them or their ultimate cause (a huge crowds of stupid people).
</p>

<p>
Just like a surfer, <i>to stay alive</i> one has to understand the waves and currents and never go against them, no matter how it feels.
</p>

<p>
Degenerates are buying, <i>high on idiotic unsubstantiated copium,</i> right into an onsetting global recession caused by very obvious factors? <i>So be it - let the chips fall where they may</i>. Do not try to argue with them or to convince anyone that you know better.
</p>

<p>
Actual trading is to have a <i>dashboard of an airplane</i> which shows you what is <i>actually going on</i> (not what you <i>imagine or feel</i>). Yes, degens are buying, the <i>slope</i> is high, the velocity is high, but volume is below average. This means literal degenerates are FOMOing in. Ok, ride the momentum they creted.
</p>

<p>
Never open an opposite short position just  because <i>they are &ldquo;obviously wrong&rdquo;. Timing is crucial. Short only /after</i> the momentum is gone and an <i>idiotic euphoria</i> ceased for time being.
</p>

<p>
So, go <i>with</i> them <i>never against</i> them, even if they are idiots. The waves and currents they create has its &ldquo;energy&rdquo; and &ldquo;momentum&rdquo;, so just <i>buy the dip</i> before they are FOMOing in at every single <i>higher low</i>.
</p>

<p>
FOMOing in by literal degenerates is the strongest market force. It
creates actually market currents (bull or bear &ldquo;markets&rdquo;) and waves
(long term trends). And <i>a trend is tour friend</i>.
</p>

<p>
The most difficult thing is trading is to determine and understand <i>&ldquo;time
in the market&rdquo;</i> (which beats <i>timing the market</i>, you know).
</p>

<p>
Philosophically, it is exactly the same <i>universal principle</i> discovered
and popularized by the Buddha - <i>&ldquo;to see
things as they really are&rdquo;</i>. Other formulation would have the <i>least
distance</i> from actual reality, which is a fundamental abstract
mathematical concept.
</p>

<p>
There is no other way but embed oneself right into the information flows
(a storming sea of <i>screaming bullshit</i>) and somehow measure the current
sentiments of a crowd of emotional degenerates driven by catchy stupid
memes. Yes, there is no other way - one has to be <i>embedded</i> in the real
world, just like every biological entity is.
</p>

<p>
Again, it is useless and fatal to argue with a large crowd of idiots
just like it is fatal to &ldquo;argue&rdquo; with a large wave. One has to
skillfully ride it, and that is it. No more, no less.
</p>

<p>
If you see an obvious deceptive shilling that works (it moves the price)
never try to argue or fight it. Just open a position <i>in the direction in
which the crowd goes</i>. Shilling is a for-profit activity, which implies
there <i>is</i> a profit at least for the paid shills.
</p>

<p>
Markets are vastly complex social processes (actual social reactors) and
are impossible to be comprehended and understood neither in their
entirety, nor in all the particular details, which constantly evolve
both at the level of details and as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Just like with the weather on a particular coast, one has to study and
understand common, <i>re-emerging patterns</i> and act accordingly, <i>never
trying to predict</i>, but always to &ldquo;read ahead&rdquo; and <i>anticipate</i>.
</p>

<p>
One must never think of what the weather will be, but to see and react
to actual <i>weather-forming patterns</i> which are already <i>out there</i>. Just
like with <i>bike riding</i>, one has to <i>react to what actually is</i>, not what
one thinks would be in some abstract future. One rides a here and now,
and this is <i>the only way to survive</i>.
</p>

<p>
And yes, one must ignore what degenerates are screaming to each other
about trading. Just listen to where they are going right now and why
they think this is the only way to go.
