      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcaeb69f">
        <p>There is no such thing as randomness. This is just an
        abstract mathematical concept. Vastly complex causality
        relations are not random.</p>
        <p>Price actions are not random. They are caused by all the
        actions (and inaction) of all active and passive market
        participants, acting according to their current
        views/models and sets of beliefs.</p>

      <h2 id="org24d546d">The mind</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org24d546d">
        <p>There is an ancient Eastern philosophy of the mind,
        based on Upanishads and some early Buddhist texts. The main
        premise is that there is a “<i>weil</i>” created by our
        minds, which distorts and partially conceals What Is Real,
        and there is a <i>Path</i> for penetrating through this
        weil, which is called Maya principle.</p>
        <p>Every higher animal builds and maintains some inner
        <i>representation</i> of its shared environment inside its
        brain, using a specialized neural circuitry (regions of the
        brain) which has been evolved to “perfectly” match the
        environment. At least the evolutionary process selected the
        most accurate representations, which is the key to quick
        adaptation.</p>
        <p>Any living organism acts according to its current
        representation (or a “map”, which is not a territory) of
        its environment or what we would call “Reality”, and never,
        in principle, according to Reality itself.</p>
        <p>Any <i>representation</i> has been formed based on
        restricted <i>sensory input</i> from the evolved organs of
        perception and <i>signal-processing</i> biological
        machinery (built out neurons), so it is by definition not
        “perfect” or even accurate. It is just <i>good-enough</i>
        and matches the actual physical <i>constraints</i> of the
        environment</p>
        <p>Brain’s circuitry evolved to <i>filter out</i> most of
        irrelevant details and particulars and to react to some
        <i>common events</i> in the environment, such as <i>sudden
        motions</i>, sounds, day/night or weather changes. We would
        call these “evolved hard-wired heuristics”. The principle
        is that no living being sees all aspects of reality, leave
        alone it as a <i>Whole</i>.</p>
        <p>In any species <i>learning</i> is based on repeated
        exposure (each particular experience <i>reinforces</i> some
        pre-arranged by evolution neuron networks, just like muscle
        tissue) and <i>social conditioning</i> which is also a
        repeated exposure to some socially constructed stimuli,
        <i>verbal</i> or <i>visual</i>.</p>

      <h2 id="org9811966">Religions</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9811966">
        <p>Trading is a vastly complex, socially constructed
        system, based on a set of shared beliefs, similar in
        principles and methodologies to organized religions. There
        is much more from a religion than from any science, given
        that organized religions readily employ pseudo-scientific
        narratives.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, trading activities should be viewed as
        <i>socially constructed</i> and, just like religious
        rituals, <i>self-reinforced</i> - i.e. based on
        observations of activities of other participants of a
        sect.</p>
        <p>There is literally nothing else behind the rituals, but
        traditional dogmas and the notion of “doing things in
        strictly the right way in accordance with a multitude of
        seemingly relevant and logical minute details”.</p>
        <p>There is, of course, a wast “religious” literature about
        trading, comprised mostly of commentaries and advises of
        fully initiated.</p>
        <p>Just as with religions, the ones who really benefited
        are merchants selling stuff, various middlemen and hotel
        owners. There is a whole industry around retail trading of
        crypto, and they live off commissions, slippage and
        fees.</p>

      <h2 id="org0196666">Reaction and anticipation</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0196666">
        <p>All biological systems, which we would call
        <i>species</i>, evolved to <i>react quickly and
        adequately</i> to repeated common <i>events</i> in the
        shared environment and to <i>anticipate</i> repeated (and
        therefore <i>probable</i>) events. This seems to be an
        <i>universal</i> strategy.</p>
        <p>Notice that no animal or a biological system is trying
        to <i>predict</i> (because predictions are
        <i>inaccurate</i>) anything, only react according to
        hard-wired (evolved) heuristics.</p>
        <p>it is also an <i>evolutionary stable strategy</i> to
        over-estimate the danger and over-react (run away from a
        shadow), but at the same time <i>very quickly recover</i>
        and switch back to the normal mode of operations. It takes
        a few seconds for most animals to recover from <i>pain</i>
        and/or <i>fear</i>.</p>

      <h2 id="org8e2c493">Supervised learning</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8e2c493">
        <p>Environment (Reality) is the best <i>supervisor</i> and
        in the long-enough run a match could be “perfect”.
        Unfortunately, we don’t have time.</p>
        <p>The key principle with <i>supervised learning</i> is
        that the environment has to be <i>stable</i>. No learning
        is possible in a chaos, which lacks stable <i>patterns</i>.
        No life is possible in a chaos, and no learning
        (adaptation). The Causality Principle and <i>stable
        intermediate forms</i> are required.</p>

      <h2 id="org4b31c0f">Other people</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4b31c0f">
        <p>Everything which we “register” with our “sensors” in the
        Marker are the <i>consequences</i> of recent actions of
        other people (or software agents).</p>
        <p>At every moment we have a <i>snapshot</i> of the
        <i>sum-total</i> (result) of <i>all</i> actions (and
        inaction) of <i>all</i> active and passive market
        participants. No more, no less.</p>
        <p>What we “see” is <i>already in the past</i> - it is
        already a <i>record</i> - a history. We have to <i>react to
        what is already happened</i>, which is, if you think for a
        moment, is the only way.</p>

      <h2 id="org109dfd9">Weather patterns</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org109dfd9">
        <p>There is no way to predict anything but to anticipate
        and be prepared.</p>
        <p>Weather patterns, situation on a road, could be seen
        within a very short, almost immediate <i>frame</i> (of the
        environment) and this <i>frame</i> is enough to react
        adequately.</p>
        <p>We are <i>not trying to predict the weather in the long
        run</i>, instead we are observing the actual processes
        <i>right here and right now</i> (In a current locality) and
        identity the actual patterns in a given <i>frame</i>.</p>
        <p><i>Predictions will fail</i> with the probability
        <code>0.5</code>, while in observing the actual patterns
        there is <i>no uncertainty</i>.</p>
        <p>The processes we observe are <i>continuous</i>, so they
        <i>continue to change (evolve) as we observe</i>, so our
        <i>perception</i> of them is necessarily continuous and
        changing too. <i>Patterns which we derive</i>, however, are
        “stable”.</p>
