<h2 id="org9a6b0ed">Principles</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9a6b0ed">
<p>
There is no such thing as randomness. This is just an abstract
mathematical concept. Vastly complex causality relations are not random.
</p>

<p>
Price actions are not random. They are caused by all the actions (and inaction) of all
active and passive market participants, acting according to their current views/models and sets of beliefs.
</p>

<p>
There is no such thing as independence in markets. Traders are watching the same charts, even of seemingly unrelated markets, reading the same news and articles, being swayed by the same FOMO emotions and current memes.
</p>

<p>
There are always two sides within every trade, so number of buyers is always equal to the number of sellers, however there is <i>eagerness</i> (a strong urge) to buy or sell.
</p>

<p>
The buying or selling pressure is willingness to buy above or to sell below the market and this <i>eagerness</i> to buy or sell is what actually moves the price.
</p>

<p>
Markets are driven by human psychology based on current sets of beliefs, dominant emotion and brainwashing by social media and memes.
</p>

<p>
The basic assumption about intelligent, rational agents trying to maximize their return with optimization methods is just naive abstract academic bullshit.
</p>

<p>
In reality there are huge crowds of degens swayed by emotions of FOMO, greed and fear.

<div id="outline-container-org535a62b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org535a62b">The mind</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org535a62b">
<p>
There is an ancient Eastern philosophy of the mind, based on Upanishads
and some early Buddhist texts. The main premise is that there is a
&ldquo;<i>weil</i>&rdquo; created by our minds, which distorts and partially conceals
What Is Real, and there is a <i>Path</i> for penetrating through this weil,
which is called Maya principle.
</p>

<p>
Every higher animal builds and maintains some inner <i>representation</i> of
its shared environment inside its brain, using a specialized neural
circuitry (regions of the brain) which has been evolved to &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo;
match the environment. At least the evolutionary process selected the
most accurate representations, which is the key to quick adaptation.
</p>

<p>
Any living organism acts according to its current representation (or a
&ldquo;map&rdquo;, which is not a territory) of its environment or what we would
call &ldquo;Reality&rdquo;, and never, in principle, according to Reality itself.
</p>

<p>
Any <i>representation</i> has been formed based on restricted <i>sensory input</i>
from the evolved organs of perception and <i>signal-processing</i>
biological machinery (built out neurons), so it is by definition not
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; or even accurate. It is just <i>good-enough</i> and matches the
actual physical <i>constraints</i> of the environment
</p>

<p>
Brain&rsquo;s circuitry evolved to <i>filter out</i> most of irrelevant details and
particulars and to react to some <i>common events</i> in the environment,
such as <i>sudden motions</i>, sounds, day/night or weather changes.
We would call these &ldquo;evolved hard-wired heuristics&rdquo;. The principle is
that no living being sees all aspects of reality, leave alone it as a <i>Whole</i>.
</p>

<p>
In any species <i>learning</i> is based on repeated exposure (each particular
experience <i>reinforces</i> some pre-arranged by evolution neuron networks,
just like muscle tissue) and <i>social conditioning</i> which is also a
repeated exposure to some socially constructed stimuli, <i>verbal</i> or
<i>visual</i>.
</p>

<h2 id="org4e0ba99">Religions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4e0ba99">
<p>
Trading is a vastly complex, socially constructed system, based on a set
of shared beliefs, similar in principles and methodologies to organized
religions. There is much more from a religion than from any science,
given that organized religions readily employ pseudo-scientific narratives.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, trading activities should be viewed as <i>socially constructed</i>
and, just like religious rituals, <i>self-reinforced</i> - i.e. based on observations
of activities of other participants of a sect.
</p>

<p>
There is literally nothing else behind the rituals, but traditional
dogmas and the notion of &ldquo;doing things in strictly the right way in
accordance with a multitude of seemingly relevant and logical minute details&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, a wast &ldquo;religious&rdquo; literature about trading,
comprised mostly of commentaries and advises of fully initiated.
</p>

<p>
Just as with religions, the ones who really benefited are merchants
selling stuff, various middlemen and hotel owners. There is a whole
industry around retail trading of crypto, and they live off commissions,
slippage and fees.

<h2 id="org9a3bcd6">Reaction and anticipation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9a3bcd6">
<p>
All biological systems, which we would call <i>species</i>, evolved to <i>react
quickly and adequately</i> to repeated common <i>events</i> in the shared
environment and to <i>anticipate</i> repeated (and therefore <i>probable</i>)
events. This seems to be an <i>universal</i> strategy.
</p>

<p>
Notice that no animal or a biological system is trying to <i>predict</i>
(because predictions are <i>inaccurate</i>) anything, only react according to
hard-wired (evolved) heuristics.
</p>

<p>
it is also an <i>evolutionary stable strategy</i> to over-estimate the danger
and over-react (run away from a shadow), but at the same time <i>very quickly
recover</i> and switch back to the normal mode of operations. It takes
a few seconds for most animals to recover from <i>pain</i> and/or <i>fear</i>.

<h2 id="org4a859e8">Supervised learning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4a859e8">
<p>
Environment (Reality) is the best <i>supervisor</i> and in the long-enough run
a match could be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have time.
</p>

<p>
The key principle with <i>supervised learning</i> is that the environment has
to be <i>stable</i>. No learning is possible in a chaos, which lacks stable
<i>patterns</i>. No life is possible in a chaos, and no learning
(adaptation). The Causality Principle and <i>stable intermediate forms</i> are required.

<h2 id="orgce28bbc">Other people</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgce28bbc">
<p>
Everything which we &ldquo;register&rdquo; with our &ldquo;sensors&rdquo; in the Marker are
the <i>consequences</i> of recent actions of other people (or software
agents).
</p>

<p>
At every moment we have a <i>snapshot</i> of the <i>sum-total</i> (result) of <i>all</i>
actions (and inaction) of <i>all</i> active and passive market participants.
No more, no less.
</p>

<p>
What we &ldquo;see&rdquo; is <i>already in the past</i> - it is already a <i>record</i> - a
history. We have to <i>react to what is already happened</i>, which is, if
you think for a moment, is the only way.

<div id="outline-container-orgbde619c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbde619c">Weather patterns</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbde619c">
<p>
There is no way to predict anything but to anticipate and be prepared.
</p>

<p>
Weather patterns, situation on a road, could be seen within a very
short, almost immediate <i>frame</i> (of the environment) and this <i>frame</i> is
enough to react adequately.
</p>

<p>
We are <i>not trying to predict the weather in the long run</i>, instead we are
observing the actual processes <i>right here and right now</i> (In a current
locality) and identity the actual patterns in a given <i>frame</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Predictions will fail</i> with the probability <code>0.5</code>, while in observing
the actual patterns there is <i>no uncertainty</i>.
</p>

<p>
The processes we observe are <i>continuous</i>, so they <i>continue to change
(evolve) as we observe</i>, so our <i>perception</i> of them is necessarily
continuous and changing too. <i>Patterns which we derive</i>, however, are
&ldquo;stable&rdquo;.
