Modern &ldquo;finance&rdquo; is famous for piling up abstractions on to of each
other to the point that no one understands the actual dynamics and this,
unironically, keeps the whole thing &ldquo;safe&rdquo; since at some point no one
touches it anymore - it becomes a solidified cathedral of abstract
bullshit, until it crashes down, like that Celsius or FTX .
</p>

<p>
The finanical theory is general relies haavily on a fundamentally wrong
assumption, which underlies the abstract probability theory too, that
obverved events (values of a so-called &ldquo;random variable&rdquo;) are
independent from each other, and therefore some inferred properties,
like the &ldquo;law&rdquo; of large numbers hold.
</p>

<p>
Once the <i>independence assumption</i> (and the abstract concept of
mathematical randomness) are removed, everything collapses back to
uncertainty, which is exactly right, provided that the factors which
will create further events are not there yet or did not have enough
weight.
</p>

<p>
This is why event the less wrong, frequency-based probabilities does not
apply, because the system under observation are not &ldquo;closed&rdquo; and <i>fully
observable</i> in principle. Past performance does not imply anything certain, only
reinforces common <i>beliefs</i>.
</p>

<p>
What then about all these PhD-level books? Just abstract <i>sectarian
bullshit</i>.
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t you remember books about Freudian &ldquo;psychology&rdquo; with an ego,
super-ego and shieeet? Well, just like the whole field went from
Freudian abstract bullshit, via Milgram, to <i>Evolutionary Psychology</i>,
finance went from its own abstract bullshit (assumptions of rationality,
independence, efficiency) to what we call &ldquo;behavioral finance&rdquo; where
huge crowds of idiots are swayed by greed, fear, mass
hysteria and clever memes in an environment full of &ldquo;bad actors&rdquo; of any
imaginable kind.
</p>

<p>
What we need, however, are <i>simplest</i> but correct mathematical modes which
<i>formally define</i> what we are talking about. Every single word we use, at
least in theory, should have precise mathematical meaning, and this is
not that hard as long as we remain grounded into reality and did not
invent abstract bullshit.
</p>

<p>
Where the &ldquo;real stuff&rdquo; may come from? From the &ldquo;<i>wire</i>&rdquo; which links
transacting (<i>in-wire representations</i> of values) entities and from
transactions themselves (what goes where).
</p>

<p>
Thus we do not start from the abstract theories of modern finance, but
from <i>reverse-engineering</i> of how particular trading platforms. <code>Binance</code>
did excellent job of making its API and underlying basic math publicly
available, which was one of the reasons of its enormous success - they
made the basic things clear and transparent.
</p>

<p>
So, unless we are market-makers we have to focus on on-the-wire transactions and how
they affect our accounts. From this we could infer precise definitions
of vague concepts.

It is tempting to belive that one could come up with a system that
correctly forecasts the future and frontrun everyone. However, there is
no such system has ever been made by Evolution itself (and there are
fundamental philosophical considerations why this is impossible in
principle). What Evolution managed to produce are <i>reactive</i> systems,
which have certain &ldquo;architectural designs&rdquo; in common, namely - sensors
and feedback loops.
</p>

<p>
To have a systems which does your <i>reactions</i> to the market conditions is
enough for everything, and just like in biology, the system should be a
hierarchy of layered interfaces, made out of <i>simple pure functions</i>.
</p>

<p>
Why no one did this so far? Because they always begin from abstract
bullshit which constitute the current consensus, and from the memes of
current mass hysteria, instead of universals and fundamental principles.
</p>

<p>
And yes, the actual code must not much bigger that underlying simplest
mathematics. The pure functional code should even be an executable
<i>specification of itself</i>.
</p>

<p>
Very few people have arrived at these decisions because, again, the
whole industry is an organized &ldquo;religion&rdquo; of <i>imperative</i>, object-oriented
crap, no one fully understands (yes, this is the same as modern
finance). They start from <code>C++</code> because it is &ldquo;industry standard&rdquo; and
ended up with piles upon piles of <i>low-level verbosity</i> no one is able to comprehend.
</p>

<p>
I really envy these Cornell graduates and PhDs who has been taught the
fundamental principles and proper languages (since MIT dropped Scheme
and slided into the imperative OOP hell, Cornell becamethe number one
classic school) and how they just applied their classic principle-guided
knowledge to automate trading.
</p>

<p>
The usual problem is that <i>disentanglement, reformulation,
simplification and formal verification</i> takes time, and time is the most
scarcest resource after attention span and ability to focus.
