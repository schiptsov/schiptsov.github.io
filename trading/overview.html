    <p>#+TITLE overview</p>
    <p>Depending on which market one have to put emphasis on
    certain patterns which may emerge from the apparent chaos
    (incomprehensible complexity)</p>
    <p>Depending on which trend, one has to look at particular
    parts of the graph, such as lower or upper edges of ranges.</p>
    <p>Basically, the most powerful patterns are Double Top in a
    bull (signalling a possible major reversal) and Higher Low,
    signalling “resuning” an uptrend after a failed, false
    reversal.</p>
    <p>False break outs are in the bear markets are fast and
    violent, fueled by hopium of amateurs and FOMO. They usually
    create nice, long wicks.</p>
    <p>The end of a major panic selloff is also a wick. It is
    called “to catch a falling knife”. A bounces (reversals) are
    fast and powerful, just like “physical” bounces of a ball.</p>
    <p>If there is no bounce this is not a local “bottom”.</p>
    <p>All the sharp moves and market “runs” are due to
    particularly strong emptions of fear of a loss, or <i>Fear Of
    Missing Out</i> which is the main force behind <i>hopium</i>
    fuelled rallies.</p>
    <p>Everything sounds logical and reasonable. The only problems
    is that these advices are advices of a coach outside of a
    boximg ring. Trading is taking an actual fight inside a ring -
    a completely different experience from studying the theory and
    patterns. Another comparison is a theoretical training of a
    pilot versus actual flight, or the same like participating in a
    <i>Moto Grand Prix</i>. Or in a war on actual front lines.</p>
    <p>This is why sellers of books and few day curses are just
    boxing coaches and they make consistently more money safely and
    easily. No coach is going inside a ring or actually ride that
    suberbike.</p>
