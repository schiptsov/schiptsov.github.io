The most important quotes about trading come from Mike Tyson, the boxer.
</p>

<p>
<i>“Everybody thinks this is a tough man’s sport. This is not a tough man’s sport. This is a thinking man’s sport. A tough man is gonna get hurt real bad in this sport.”</i>
― <b>Mike Tyson</b>
</p>

<p>
This is the most important and insightful one. Just to accept and sustain loses is not enough.
</p>

<p>
<i>“Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.”</i>
— <b>Bruce Lee</b>
</p>

<p>
This is about the futility of abstract theories and theoretic &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, and actual <i>learning by doing</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>“A year from now you may wish you had started today.”</i>
— <b>Karen Lamb</b>
</p>

<p>
This, again, is about <i>slow</i> but steady learning by doing.
</p>

<p>
<i>“A good fighter needs to be diligent, committed and disciplined doing what you
hate to do but do it like you love it.”</i>
 – <b>Mike Tyson</b>
</p>

<p>
This is another universality. Trading is one of the most <i>toxic</i> and <i>draining</i>
activities (and an environments) on earth. But the rewards are also high.
</p>

<p>
<i>“Fear is the greatest obstacle to learning. But fear is your best friend. Fear is like fire. If you learn to control it, you let it work for you. If you don’t learn to control it, it’ll destroy you and everything around you.”</i>
― <b>Mike Tyson</b>, Undisputed Truth
</p>

<p>
<i>“A year from now you may wish you had started today.”</i>
— <b>Karen Lamb</b>
</p>

<p>
This, again, is about <i>slow</i> but steady learning by doing.
</p>

<p>
<i>“The activity you’re most avoiding contains your biggest opportunity.”</i> (Sort of. Identifying and multiplying your &ldquo;strengths&rdquo; instead of trying to fix your weakness is better). True for trading.
— Robin S. Sharma
</p>

<p>
<i>“Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.”</i>
— <b>Neale Donald Walsch</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>“If it is important to you, you will find a way. If not, you’ll find an excuse.”</i>
— <b>Ryan Blair</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>“I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.”</i>
— <b>Carl Gustav Jung</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>“It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.”</i> (the shape of a compound interest curve).
— <b>Confucius</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>“The ability to apply the discipline, the ability to do what needs to be done
no matter how he feels inside, in my opinion, is the definition of a true
professional.”</i>
― <b>Mike Tyson</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</i>
― <b>Mike Tyson</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>“Rule No. 1 is never lose money. Rule No. 2 is never forget Rule No. 1.”</i>
― <b>Warren Buffett</b>
</p>

<p>
Yes, <i>winning is not losing</i> (I am quoting myself).
</p>

<p>
<i>“Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</i>
― <b>John Maynard Keynes</b>
</p>

<p>
This is about <i>never fighting the market</i> and <i>never trading against the current major
trend</i>, fueled by other degens (FOMO-ing in).
</p>

<p>
<i>“I already know what giving up feels like. I want to see what happens if I don’t.”</i>
— <b>Neila Rey</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>“If you want something you have never had, you must be willing to do something you have never done.”</i>
— <b>Thomas Jefferson</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Buy when there&rsquo;s blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own. &rdquo;</i>
― <b>Unknown</b>
</p>

<p>
This is about <i>never being stopped out of your position</i> by irrational exuberance
of other degens. This is also about &ldquo;buying the dip&rdquo; and &ldquo;catching falling knives&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Behind this quite is just the basic fact of <i>frequency-based statistics</i>.
