<h1 class="title">Bullshit, bullshit everywhere</h1>
</header><p>
The whole literature of <i>using machine learning or advanced statistics
for time series forecasting</i> is just sectarian bullshit.
</p>

<p>
It takes some time for the realization that almost everything you read
is bullshit to sink in. This is because writing itself degraded from a method of transmission of
knowledge to profit and attention seeking activity.
</p>

<p>
Ok, why this is bullshit? Well, time series are <i>logs of numerical
measurements of some outcomes</i> of some unknown set processes with unknown
characteristics. Ok, <i>partially</i> known.
</p>

<p>
Any serious analysis require a <i>regular closure</i> - all the factors are
enumerated and known (nothing is missed, nothing is imaginary or
redundant), all weights are correct (no overshoots), no unknown factors
could emerge, no known factors could disappear or lose its weights.
</p>

<p>
Do you know any such systems? Well, in classical mechanics and basic
non-organic chemistry, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
Let me formulate the principle. Any forecasting based on <i>logs</i> instead of
<i>analysis of factors which produced these outcomes</i> is a modern day
alchemy or just highly sophisticated bullshit. There is even a meme for
this - <i>the past performance does not predict the future returns</i>, which
is exactly the same notion.
</p>

<p>
As long as the whole system continuously evolves
while you write down your time series, they will always be outdated and
<i>already irrelevant</i> by definition. But this is a second order realization.
</p>

<p>
The first order, at least in this universe,  the Causality Principle,
and unless you can <i>close on</i> a certain set of multiple causes (multiple causation
is <i>the</i> universal principle) you cannot predict or forecast anything at
all. Any <i>correlations</i> would be <i>due to a chance</i> and will be imaginary and wrong.
</p>

<p>
The factors which will influence the further events are either not here
yet, or won&rsquo;t be there, or will lose its significance or will gain an
enormous weight.
</p>

<p>
One more time - time series, which are just logs of already happened
outcomes, <i>do not contain any actual relevant data to base the forecast on</i>. It is
just like predicting a fire by smoke instead of what is actually burning
and other physical factors.
</p>

<p>
So, <i>everything you read about forecasting financial markers based on
time-series</i> is bullshit. Correlations may emerge due to the fact that
millions of people (and bots) are looking at and reacting on the same
emerging patterns on an essentially the same chart, so there is always some
<i>synchrony</i> and some <i>consistent</i> actions (like FOMOing in) out of it.
</p>

<p>
Why do people buy this crap? Well, because most of them think that it
cannot be just all nonsense, and something must be working, and one should
give it a try (without understanding, of course).
</p>

<p>
In reality, however, sectarian &ldquo;teachings&rdquo; and supporting literature is
much more common and general phenomena, and yes, it is all sectarian
nonsense.
</p>

<p>
Trading systems definitely could be made, but they must have nothing to do with
forecasting or predicting (which is impossible due to the principles
outlined above), but being <i>reactive</i> and <i>ahead looking</i> instead.
</p>

<p>
By the way, no animals <i>forecast</i> anything. They just <i>know</i> how to <i>react to
changes</i>.
