Nothing clarifies the mind better that writing.
</p>

<p>
Lamport&rsquo;s quote about writing goes here.
</p>

<p>
Plain text is good medium, but it does not have enough structure. Words,
sentences, paragraphs and whole articles are enough for a prose, but
technical writing requires more structure.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lists</i> are the most fundamental way in which a human mind (a mind of an
external observer) arranges its concepts. By writing down a list of
items the mind focuses itself, and by comprehending a whole list at once
the mind could see a bigger picture.
</p>

<p>
A simple list <i>sorted by implicit priorities</i> is a half of any planing
system. A single glance over it tells a lot. The ability to quickly
re-arrange such a list according to the current circumstances (changing
priorities) is another <i>third</i>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Org-mode</code> is about nesting and folding.
</p>

<p>
Deeply <i>nested lists</i> reflect the structure of knowledge (from the most
 abstract and general, to more detailed and specialized and all the way
 down to particulars). It allows the mind to easily traverse any
 selected branch of  the whole hierarchy up and down.
</p>

<p>
Folding allows the mind to <i>focus at a particular level</i> - to narrow it
down to a necessary level of abstraction.
</p>

<p>
<code>Org-mode</code> improves one&rsquo;s writing, because it prompts the mind to
arrange their concepts in <i>natural</i> hierarchical, tree-like structures
(remember, that <i>evolution is a tree</i>, and a <i>deeply nested list</i> is a
tree).
</p>

<p>
There is no rigorous thinking (or writing) without founding the
reasoning on  an appropriate branch of mathematics. Without formal
mathematical models (however simple) any thinking is sloppy, <i>biased
towards your naive assumptions</i> and wishful.
</p>

<p>
Math is easy to write in <code>Org-mode</code> - it allows to embed the standard
 LaTeX syntax almost everywhere. To see the result one has to render the
 resulting document using LaTeX or any other tool (such as MathJax).
</p>

<p>
<code>Org-mode</code> allows embedding of <i>source code blocks</i> in almost any
language, and even to evaluate these code blocks within a document. The
most important aspect is that the code is an <i>additional, refined
structure</i> for domain knowledge.
</p>

<p>
You can <i>export</i> your structured writing into all the reasonable formats -
HTML, Makrdown, LaTex, PDF.
</p>

<p>
Just use the structural and folding features and leave the time planing
aspect to useless managers. You will see improvements in a couple of
weeks, if not days. Everything that disciplines mind is good for you.
