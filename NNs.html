We know the inputs and know the result and know the mathematical expression.
</p>

<p>
Every mathematical expression can be turned into an Abstract Syntax Tree.
</p>

<p>
A <i>Tree</i> here is crucial - this is how the individual &ldquo;arrows&rdquo; are arranged.
</p>

<p>
The Arrows &ldquo;arise&rdquo; from currying of binary functions, which corresponds to the common <i>infix binary</i> operators, such as \(+\) or \(*\).
</p>

<p>
An AST shows how values &ldquo;flow through&rdquo; an expression. There is always a <i>direction</i> in every evaluation.
</p>

<p>
In addition to values of the parameters, an AST of a <i>partially</i> (or fully) evaluated expression may hold (memoize) some intermediate results, including derivatives of the function with respect to each of the values.
</p>

<p>
As long as everything in the representation of an expression is <i>referentially transparent</i> and <i>immutable</i> the math will &ldquo;work&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
To change the outputs without changing the inputs of a <i>nested</i> expression (the nesting of at least one level deep is required), the only way is to <i>scale the parameters of the functions</i>. The functions themselves are, of course, immutable.
</p>

<p>
This is how we a representation of a complex mathematical expression &ldquo;learns&rdquo; - the &ldquo;weights&rdquo; of the arguments are being updated.
</p>

<p>
The process of updating of the wights can be done in a <i>systematic way</i>, using the notion of a <i>partial derivative</i> of a binary (curried) function with respect to each of its parameters.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the derivative is defined as the <i>slope</i> to a function at a particular point.
</p>

<p>
The notion of a <i>differentiable function</i> includes the notion of <i>continuity</i> (of having no gaps or kinks).
</p>

<p>
In the mathematical expressions which represent neural nets we do not have arbitrary functions, on the contrary, we have functions of very particular kind.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>addition (putting together)</li>
<li>negation</li>
<li>adding of a negative number</li>
<li>scaling (multiplying)</li>
<li>adding to itself n times (repeated addition)</li>
<li>taking apart into a number of equal parts</li>
<li>rising into a power (exponentiation)</li>
<li>division as rising into a negative power</li>
<li>logarithms and recipricals</li>
</ul>

<p>
We intentionally de-generalize multiplication and division.
</p>

<p>
Out of these functions the nodes of an AST are being formed. The nodes then are &ldquo;decorated&rdquo; with additional intermediate results (values).
</p>

<p>
Another fundamental <i>kind of operations</i> being used is a <i>structural transformation</i> of the values, without losing or discarding of any information.
</p>

<p>
Such operations must be reversible, which imply no information loss.
</p>

<p>
A function must be <i>differentiable</i>, which means to have a non-vertical <i>tangent line</i> at every point. So, \(y=Constant\) (collapse to a single value) are ok, but \(x=Constant\) (just a constant) are not.
