The &ldquo;Lua revolution&rdquo; makes everything even more a mess. Some stable arrangements
will <i>eventually</i> emerge from the <i>bullshit-mill</i> of enthusiastic amateur
monkey-patching, we just have to wait for a while.
</p>

<p>
The main problem is that very enthusiastic but also very amateur coders just
copy-paste snippets they do not fully understand from one another (literally)
and those who &ldquo;design&rdquo; APIs never think more that a few seconds, if at all.
</p>

<p>
The old times (the golden age) when very few programmers with required deep math
background used only <i>list structures</i> are gone forever.
</p>

<p>
No one novadays is carefully designed a <i>call-site of an interface</i>, specifying which arguments are optional, what default values are, etc.
If you miss an argument in an untyped dynamic language &ldquo;nothing happens&rdquo;, it
continues silently without an error.

<code>[Neo]Vi[m]</code> is <i>great</i> (plain and simple) because it uses a <i>pattern language</i> (similar in
its nature to <i>regular expressions</i>) to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; about the contents of a text file,
and <i>systematically binds</i> single-letter commands (with optional uniform <i>prefixes</i>) to particular actions on a
common patterns.
</p>

<p>
The key to deep understanding is <i>systematic</i> (and the resulting <i>uniformity</i>). This
<i>emergent</i> (or evolved,
literally) system is what makes <code>[Neo]Vi[m]</code> great.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental (and rather obvious) principle is that one &ldquo;thinks in terms of&rdquo;
and &ldquo;acts upon&rdquo; various <i>parts and chunks of text</i> (depending upon a particular
context), NOT single characters.
</p>

<p>
In <code>[Neo]Vi[m]</code> one should NEVER use arrow keys or <code>jkhl</code>. This is a consequence of
the <i>wrong way of thinking</i> - at a single character level (<code>H</code> and <code>L</code>, are much more useful).
</p>

<p>
A <i>pro</i> moves with increasingly larger chunks of text - <i>words, whole sentences,
paragraphs</i> and in the context of a programming language - with distinct chunks
of code, usually consistent with <i>indentation</i> and <i>formatting</i>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Neovim</code> has a generalized notion of <code>tree-sitter</code> based <i>textobjects</i> (while simple
textobjects were available in the classic <code>Vim</code>).
</p>

<h2 id="orgaaa4ad4">Systematic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaaa4ad4">
<p>
It seems that there is not much one can do within a text file - just moving into
this or that direction with increasing or decreasing &ldquo;steps&rdquo;.
<code>w</code>, <code>W</code>, <code>}</code> etc. or <code>b</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>{</code> ~ or, lets say <code>0</code>, <code>$</code>. The <code>e</code> command is sibling of <code>w</code>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that there is a systematic difference between what a <i>capital letter
command</i> does relative to what does the lower-case counterpart.
</p>

<p>
Not just that, but these &ldquo;steps&rdquo; above act as <i>modifiers</i> for commands such as <code>c</code>,
<code>d</code>, <code>y</code>, etc.
</p>

<p>
And there are <i>universal numeric modifiers</i>, so <code>3w</code> means <i>3 words</i> and <code>y3w</code> means
<i>yank 3 words</i>. and <code>3yy</code> would be <i>yank 3 lines</i>.
</p>

<p>
This emergent and then evolved <i>system</i> is what makes <code>[Neo]Vi[m]</code> unique and being
emulated within other editors.
</p>

<p>
To understand and learn it one has to start with these fundamentals. Everything
else, due to being <i>systematic</i> is almost self-evident and one&rsquo;s informed guesses
would almost always turn out to be valid ones.
</p>

<p>
Modern <code>neovim</code> is <i>big</i>. It is not <i>wast</i> as modern <code>Emacs</code>, but nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, using <code>vi</code> with arrow keys, just like, lets say <code>SublimeText</code> or <code>VSCode</code>,
defies the very meaning of using <code>vi</code>. No wonder it feels awkward. In fact <i>both</i>
<code>vi</code> and <code>Emacs</code> should be deeply understood and mastered and being used depending
upon context (<code>vi</code> is great for a quick, &ldquo;in-place&rdquo; modifications of configs or code, while <code>Emacs</code> is
great for long writing sessions, and one actually never exit <code>emacs</code>).
</p>

<p>
This notion is deeply related to the notion of coding in one (may be great)
language just like they code in another (which may be just low-effort, never deeply researched
amateur kitchen-sink crap).
</p>

<p>
<i>Both</i> <code>vi</code> and <code>Emacs</code> are &ldquo;ancient traditions&rdquo; worth being familiar with.
