It seems that evolution process discovered these <i>stable intermediate forms</i>, which has been successfully generalized and abstracted out by multi-discipline institutions, like MIT, which are famous for using insights from Molecular Biology. Alan Kay also successfully translated insights from biology into computer systems.
</p>

<p>
Abstraction barriers (atoms is an ultimate abstraction barrier)
</p>

<p>
Cell-membrane (lambda, module, interface)
</p>

<p>
Nesting (function composition)
</p>

<p>
Recursion (spiral-shaped processes with a termination condition)
</p>

<p>
Layered systems (cells, tissues, organs, subsystems)
</p>

<p>
Linear sequences (proteins)
</p>

<p>
Tree-line structures (neurons)
</p>

<p>
Lookup tables (RNA translation)
</p>

<p>
Encapsulated state (closures)
</p>

<p>
Signals (synapses)
</p>

<p>
Message passing (inter-cellular communication)

There is no wonder that Scheme has been born in MIT as a synthesis of The Lambda Calculus and Molecular Biology.
</p>

<p>
It was remarkable, historic achievement when Scheme&rsquo;s <i>Environment Model</i> has been implemented in Scheme using just a few <i>special forms</i> and lists, <i>trees</i> and a <i>lookup table (made out of lists)</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is a true <i>biological</i> system - it reuses simple, <i>universal</i>, <i>stable intermediate forms</i> as basic building blocks. In the case of Scheme it was <i>lambdas</i> and <i>lists</i> (where <i>lambdas and actual closures were made out of lists</i>).
</p>

<p>
The actual evaluator (a <i>defining interpreter</i>) has been literally a few pages long and could be understood in its entirety by an ordinary person. The <i>standard library</i> was another few pages.
</p>

<p>
Think of lists as <i>proteins</i> of programming. LISP and MIT guys did.
</p>

<p>
<i>All you need is /lambda</i>. Lambdas were <i>enzymes</i> of programming. They has been made out of <i>proteins</i> (lists), of course.
</p>

<p>
This is how to program and this Golden Age has been lost forever. SML/NJ, Miranda, MIT Scheme and Erlang are the last standing monuments of unsurpassable glory.

This is not an arbitrary coincidence that every Functional Language, beginning from ISWIM, rely heavily on a <i>list structure</i>, even using special syntax (<i>syntactic sugar</i>) for lists. This reflects how fundamental and universal they are. Other universal data structures, such as <i>trees</i> and <i>tables</i> has been made originally out of <i>lists</i>.
</p>

<p>
The main principle is <i>composition</i> (of functions or <i>monads</i>), and it is natural in pure functional languages or subsets.
</p>

<p>
Just remember that composition is <i>nesting</i> under the hood. It is that fundamental.
</p>

<p>
We nest <i>types</i> and while a function is a value of a <i>primitive</i> type <code>A -&gt; B</code>, a Monad is an ADT (<i>Abstract Data Type</i>) and has at least <code>2</code> functions (with different <i>signatures</i>) in its <i>interface</i>. So in the case of a Monad we compose (and actually nest) ADTs.
</p>

<p>
Again, a <i>Monad</i> is just an <i>ADT</i> with additional &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of a <i>Monoid</i>, whose values can be <i>composed (technically it has to form a Monoid with respect to its functions, which, in turn, form an abstraction barrier, as a standard interface)</i>, similar to composition of functions (which are values too). An ADT which must form a <i>Monoid</i>. Nothing to see here.

One has to reuse these enormous efforts (both in terms of
research and man-hours) while restricting oneself to most general, universal basic building blocks.
</p>

<p>
No, you don&rsquo;t need that <i>async</i> crap. Lists and Lambdas will do. Plus pure functional subset of the standard library and modules (abstraction barriers and interfaces).
</p>

<p>
You probably want <i>streams</i> and some sort of <i>reactive</i> triggers, like <i>an observable</i>. Just remember that it should be as simple as a <i>lambda</i> and a <i>condition</i> on which it would be called (and it must be a <i>closure</i> itself).
</p>

<p>
<i>Unnecessary, redundant abstractions is the root of all evil</i>. Especially in a crappy imperative, untyped languages, to which javascript is an negative optimum. (well, PHP is still the absolute worst, and Java is a monument to human stupidity).

Proteins and enzymes are good enough to &ldquo;implement&rdquo; whole Tree of Life.
</p>

<p>
It seems that <i>lambdas</i>, <i>types</i> and some syntactic sugar is enough for everything.
</p>

<p>
It is crucially important to <i>restrict oneself</i>, at least in modeling and <i>executable formal specifications</i> to these fundamental basic building blocks, just like mathematicians use the <i>DSL</i> of The Set Theory and formal Logic.
</p>

<p>
If you are able to <i>formally specify</i> (formally model) your domain in a pure functional subset of a language which uses no fancy shit, you will benefit enormously, because you would literally <i>stand on the shouters of giants</i> and your writing would be <i>eternally understable</i>, just like core mathematics itself.
