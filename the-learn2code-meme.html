<h1 class="title">The Learn To Code meme</h1>
</header><p>
Well, you literally have no idea.
</p>

<p>
There is an example of a guy you will have to compete with
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/">https://bost.ocks.org/mike/</a>
</p>

<p>
Unless you are <i>regularly</i> programming for fun since primary school you
have zero chances.
</p>

<p>
You have no idea how good Stanford or MIT grads are at general problem
solving using standard concepts and techniques of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Also look it up who <a href="lamport.html">Leslie Lamport</a> is.
</p>

<p>
Without mathematics there is no programming. Only <i>webshit</i>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3d13f68" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3d13f68">The 10,000 hours meme.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3d13f68">
<p>
One popular pop-sci writer once claimed that to master any subject (or to a
acquire a particular skill-set) requires <i>at least</i> 10,000 hours of deliberate
<i>practice</i> (excluding merely reading, watching or day-dreaming).
</p>

<p>
This sounds about right, and almost every top-performing athlete would confirm
this <i>heuristic</i>, but this is not the end of the story.
</p>

<p>
When we look at some world-class <i>top-performers</i>, we will observe another crucial
pattern - a biological one.
</p>

<p>
To become an top-tier cello player, capable of performing Bach on the best
stages, requires, it seems, something else, not merely 10,000 hours of practice.
</p>

<p>
Some particular <i>genetic traits</i> are necessary. Finest muscle coordination (a
traits of calligraphers) and what we loosely call a &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; - the ability
to efficiently reshape tissues and <i>related neurons</i> by repeating exposure to an
activity (which together is called a <i>genetic predisposition</i>).
</p>

<p>
Top tier tennis players, archers, Moto GP racers and MMA fighters all have some genetic
advantages, and <i>this</i> explains the immense <i>gap</i> between their observed (and
measured) performance and those of an average amateur.
</p>

<p>
The same principles, of course, are applicable to programming. One definitely do
not have to have an adult ADHD, and to have the opposite genetic traits -
exceptional self-control, ability to endure long hours of concentration, and
wider attention window and short term memory span.
</p>

<p>
This is what makes John Carmak, which is Mike Tyson of the field. Notice that
John is not very skilled in CS and the theories and even occasionally blunders in
the interviews - unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t academic knowledge that makes you a top-performer.
</p>

<p>
Another point is that one cannot <i>fake</i> these traits or become an <i>imposer</i> - one
either have thse traits or not, and having them manifests in the behavioral
patterns, which we usually call a &ldquo;nerd&rdquo;, &ldquo;geek&rdquo;, or an &ldquo;autist&rdquo; (which is a
misconception - most of us just develop habits to shield ourselves from unwanted
emotions we have troubles to deal with).
</p>

<p>
So, it is not true that anyone could become anything one wants. Rock climbers,
marathon runners are genetically skinny and have traits of exceptional
endurance. Guys like Mike Tyson are kings of self-discripline and self-control,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
The main point is that, just like guys with adult ADHD, one can be very busy all
day long (switching between seemingly exciting but useless tasks) and become
really spent and exhausted at night, with liteterally nothing accomplished. And
this busybody activities could <i>go on for years</i>.
</p>

<p>
Or you may watch these narcissistic Muay Thai amateur videos on Facebook. The
guys are sure they are the next Bruce Lees, while their actual performance is
way below mediocre.
</p>

<p>
So, think twice before deciding to &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
By the way, the actual coding is not even an essential skill. Problem-solving,
the ability to actually learn and self-discipline are.
