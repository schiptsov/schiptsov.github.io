<h2 id="orgee907f4">Like a good coach</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgee907f4">
<p>
A good coach tells to a boxer what to do, and what not to do, and how to do everything just right. A very good coach also tells <i>why it is so</i>.
</p>

<p>
A good coach saves time and money and ensures that fatal or just costly mistakes will be avoided. This is what you could expect.
</p>

<p>
Wast majority of programming projects simply fail or too late and over-budget because people do not do the right thing, literally.
</p>

<p>
The right thing to do is to stay on the shoulders of giants and optimize of <i>less</i> but just right &#x2013; a local optimum, being rediscovered again and again by a brute-force trial-and-error.
</p>

<p>
To really approach a local optimum is to do the right thing, which in the context of programming means to use the right paradigm, and the right tools of the trade.
</p>

<p>
As a canonical example, the sheer stupidity of reimplementing everything inside JVM is what lead to <i>gigabytes</i> of buggy imperative dependencies no one really understand. People in the industry just reinstall everything and hope for a clear start.
</p>

<p>
The programmers of the Golden Age, however, used to FFI everything (mostly Fortran and C code) and never even thought about re-implementing the wheel, especially highly optimized numerical methods or implementations of complex network protocols.
</p>

<p>
So, one just writes <i>domain-specific logic</i> in Haskell (which is a pure logic itself), FFIs everything and does an old-school file I/O, streams, pipes, queues and what not. Yes, UNIX philosophy in a pure functional language. Well, we can interface micro-services too (by FFI&rsquo;ing <code>libcurl</code> or <code>libwebsockets</code>, of course).
</p>

<p>
What we should NEVER do is to serve HTML via HTTP/2 in pure Haskell. This is a pure idiocy. Just like serving stuff in MATLAB.
</p>

<p>
To delegate is how to manage complexity.
</p>

<p>
There is no surprise. Boxing coaches always say things that can be seen as an obvious common sense. It shall to be this way. Imagine a coach telling abstract nonsense instead. And yet, we are almost drowned in the screaming ocean of abstract bullshit.
</p>

<p>
So, I write and sell text files (a <i>yardstick of civilization</i>!), which state clearly what to do, what not to do, and why this is so. This may be plain text, math or source code in different languages. I know a few.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgaa40241" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgaa40241">Just like OnlyFans, you know.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaa40241">
<p>
This is only partially a joke. The principles are <i>almost</i> the same, except that I sell, via subscription, <i>structured text files</i> instead of photos and videos.
</p>

<p>
Every other principle is intact &#x2013; as long as you find a <i>value</i> in paying for my content we will continue. Once you got enough, well, goodbye.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, if you won&rsquo;t prepay I won&rsquo;t do anything. I have a lot to do, just like you.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, you are here to make money in some software business. I am here to reduce dramatically your spending, costs and most importantly &#x2013; the number and the rate of failures, which means to make more money for you. Parts of these profits you have to pay me.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for both of us, what I am selling is not my invention, but, like some mathematics, is just an eternal knowledge discovered by people from the past. This means I literally cannot fail, just like a decent math teacher &#x2013; the math I am teaching is valid and independent of me.
</p>

<p>
Again, no one forces you to come back to the site, unless you know you need some more. It is that simple.
</p>

<p>
It has to be a simple <i>protocol</i>, and it will be that way. Think of OnlyFans for texts, math and some source code.
</p>

<p>
If you are dissatisfied with the results &#x2013; do not make a fuss, just move on.
</p>

<p>
No, I do not code remotely for $10/h in some sweatshop setting.

<p>
I am an <i>expat</i> for last <i>12 years</i> living in South Asia.
</p>

<p>
Due to the well-known events of this year (2022) I lost access to all
banking services, GSM providers and even has been banned from Binance.
</p>

<p>
Since then I decided that I will <i>never ever</i> have anything to do with
anyone or anything related to Russia. Just kindly fuck off. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
There is literally no way I could receive payments for my work in a
legal way. So you and I have to use plain old cash or crypto.
