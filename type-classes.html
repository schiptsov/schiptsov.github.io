<p>
The Buddha emphasized <i>the right (adequate, close to what actually is -
as a correct map of a certain territory) understanding</i> which is the
essential prerequisite to end (or at least diminish) suffering.
</p>

<p>
The mapping tools, or a <i>modeling framework</i> is based on certain notions
from <i>Classical Logic</i> and mathematical <i>Set Theory</i>. With these almost
everything could be adequately modeled, to give one <i>the right
understanding</i>, or, at least <i>to be less wrong</i>.
</p>

<p>
The mathematical notion of <i>&ldquo;such that&rdquo;</i> is a linguistic abstraction of
the innate ability of the mind of an external observer <i>select</i> and
<i>group</i> observable phenomena (&ldquo;objects&rdquo;) into abstract &ldquo;categories&rdquo; (or &ldquo;classes&rdquo;)
based on a certain <i>common property</i> (an attribute) which <i>all</i> or <i>some</i> objects
possess. This ability is at the core of so-called intelligence.
</p>

<p>
This &ldquo;works&rdquo; because the whole Universe is a single <i>unfolding process</i>,
so every sub-process is subject to the Causality Principle (there is no
randomness, only vastly complex causality) and everything evolves in an
imaginary tree-like structures (if we attempt to mentally trace some
process back).
</p>

<p>
In other words, <i>patterns and attributes are there</i> and they <i>are</i> due to causality.
</p>

<p>
In the context of a <i>Set theory</i>, which could be seen as a generalization
and an attempt to formally define a few universal (for the mind and the world)
 notions, <i>the imaginary, abstract, non-existent  universe of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;
of discourse</i> (or of &ldquo;values&rdquo;) is being <i>partitioned</i> into a distinct
partitions, called Sets, which are abstract &ldquo;classes&rdquo; (of the ancients) with a minimal
&ldquo;structure&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
In mathematics we write (using the <i>set comprehension notation</i>)
\[\{x \in S \mid P(x)\}\]
which means &ldquo;the elements <code>x</code> of a given set <code>S</code> <i>such that</i> (the
vertical bar) the <i>predicate</i> <code>P</code> is true for every <code>x</code>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The result form another Set - a <i>subset</i> of <code>S</code>, which may or may not be
<i>equivalent</i> to <code>S</code> itself (when <code>P(x)</code> holds <i>for all</i> elements of <code>S</code>).
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that the universal notions of <i>selection</i> (based on
some <i>property</i>) and <i>classification</i> (which mind does) has been
captured and formalized in this particular <i>piece</i> of mathematics (we do
not consider the whole Set Theory here, because some parts of it
contradict reality).
</p>

<p>
Such kind of <i>selection</i> (of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;) based on having a certain
<i>common property</i> is also known as <i>filtering</i>, and indeed, we have this
universal notion captured in a function:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #88C0D0;">filter</span> p xs <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">=</span> [x <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">|</span> x <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">&lt;-</span> xs, p x]
</pre>
</div>
<p>
which is just a different notation for the <i>set comprehension notion</i> of
mathematics.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc59df66" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc59df66">Typing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc59df66">
<p>
It should be of no surprise that these <i>universal notions</i> are at the
core of what we call type systems (or a type-discipline).
</p>

<p>
Types are just particular <i>subsets</i> of an imaginary <i>Universe of all
(possible) values</i> (which we can denote in a given language).
</p>

<p>
The classic example is Numbers - some are <i>Integers</i> (whole numbers),
some are <i>Reals</i>, and so on, as they all sit on an imaginary <i>number
line</i>.
</p>

<p>
We (in our minds) partition this imaginary <i>Universe Of All Possible
Numbers</i> into distinct Sets based on particular properties of such
numbers. These sets are <i>superimposed onto</i> the set of all numbers.
</p>

<p>
Again, we just use the mathematical notion <i>&ldquo;such that&rdquo;</i> for
partitioning.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9b9e648" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9b9e648">Type-classes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9b9e648">
<p>
A <i>type-class</i> is a notation for partitioning the imaginary <i>Universe of
All Possible Types</i> (which are defined as just <i>Sets of Values</i>).
</p>

<p>
Remember that the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; has been used by ancient Greek logicians
to refer to a particular &ldquo;group&rdquo; of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;men&rdquo; (Socrates
is a Man), and the word &ldquo;set&rdquo; has been introduce much later.
</p>

<p>
So, a <i>type-class</i> is just a particular <i>Set of Types</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is also based on the notion of <i>&ldquo;such that&rdquo;</i>, but instead of <i>logical
predicated</i> it uses the notion &ldquo;implements a given set of type-signatures&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
This captures the <i>intuitive</i>, informal notion of a &ldquo;Duck Typing&rdquo; - <i>if
 it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck&#x2026;</i>
</p>

<p>
In theory, there should be <i>a proof</i> that every type actually
implements a given <i>set of type-signatures</i> (which, by the way, is called an <i>interface</i>)
correctly, but for that we need a proof-system.
</p>

<p>
A set of type-signatures is usually augmented by formally defined
&ldquo;laws&rdquo; (stated elsewhere), such as <i>associativity</i> for a given
operator. These &ldquo;laws&rdquo; should have been formally proven too.
</p>

<p>
Supplying a corresponding <i>test-suite</i> is not a proof, but it acts as
<i>self-test</i> of an airplane - it shows that at least nothing is broken <i>yet</i>.
</p>

<p>
Last, but not least, just like Sets, these type-classes can be
&ldquo;nested&rdquo;, and there is a special syntax to express it. Nesting means
that <i>&ldquo;to be an <code>X</code> one has to be an <code>Y</code>&rdquo;</i>, which is just more
<i>specialization</i> or more <i>filtering</i>.
</p>

<p>
So, when we see something like
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #81A1C1;">class</span>  <span style="color: #8FBCBB;">Num</span> a  <span style="color: #81A1C1;">where</span>
<span style="background-color: #2E3440;"> </span>   (<span style="color: #D8DEE9;">+</span>), (<span style="color: #D8DEE9;">-</span>), (<span style="color: #D8DEE9;">*</span>)       <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">::</span> a <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">-&gt;</span> a <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">-&gt;</span> a
<span style="background-color: #2E3440;"> </span>   negate              <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">::</span> a <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">-&gt;</span> a
<span style="background-color: #2E3440;"> </span>   abs                 <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">::</span> a <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">-&gt;</span> a
<span style="background-color: #2E3440;"> </span>   signum              <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">::</span> a <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">-&gt;</span> a
<span style="background-color: #2E3440;"> </span>   fromInteger         <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">::</span> <span style="color: #8FBCBB;">Integer</span> <span style="color: #D8DEE9;">-&gt;</span> a
</pre>
</div>
<p>
(which, by the way, corresponds to another mathematical notion of a
<i>Ring</i> which includes <i>associative and commutative binary operations</i>
with certain <i>identities</i>) we recognize a definition of a Subset of
Types (tagged with the <code>Num</code> tag) <i>&ldquo;such that&rdquo;</i> this particular set
<i>inteface</i> (a set of type-signatures) has to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
And that is it. This is why it feels so familiar and &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, and
when Phil Wadler came up with his proposal, everyone were instantly
enlightened - this is just <i>types partitioned by interfaces</i> instead of
<i>logical predicates</i>.
</p>

<p>
I am not surprised that type-classes aren&rsquo;t incorporated into any other
decent languages of the ML-family, because people are arrogant and
stupid.
