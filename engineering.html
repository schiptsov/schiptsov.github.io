      <h2 id="orgd6dfccf">Fundamental notions are eternal
      (timeless)</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd6dfccf">
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>The notion of a <code>Natural Number</code> (and of a
          <i>number line</i>) will never change. <i>Peano’s
          Numbers</i> (defined in terms of <code>(+1)</code>) are
          eternal too.</li>
          <li>The notion of a <code>Set</code> (as an unordered
          abstract aggregate with nesting).</li>
          <li>The notion of a <code>Sequence</code> which always
          has a particular order and may or may not have
          duplicates.</li>
          <li>The notion of a <code>Table</code> as a Set of
          <code>Ordered Pairs</code> gives us an actual
          <i>transcoding</i>, and RNA and DNA transcription
          machinery <i>actually uses tables</i>.</li>
          <li>The notion of a <code>Path</code> as a sequence of
          steps</li>
          <li>The notions of a <code>Fork</code> and a
          <code>Join</code>, and of <code>Alternative
          outcomes</code> in general will stay.</li>
          <li>The notion of a <code>Directed Graph</code>, as a
          useful generalization, because Causality is “directed” by
          <i>unfolding of the Universe</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the notions which can be generalized from Molecular
        Biology are eternal. (The Mother Nature <i>discovered</i>
        these notions by endless <i>trial and error</i>).</p>
        <p>First of all, <i>everything in Nature has a particular
        structure</i> - nothing <i>abstract</i> ever existed.</p>
        <p>Abstractions (and generalizations, which are closer to
        <i>actuality</i>) are product of the mind of an external
        observer and does not exist anywhere outside of its head.
        Numbers and operations on them are such generalizations and
        pure abstractions.</p>
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>A symmetry of a structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The meaning of a symmetry is <i>how relevant, if at all
        the point of view (location of an observer) is</i>,
        literally.</p>
        <p><code>ox</code> becomes <code>xo</code> if one looks at
        it from different directions.</p>
        <p><code>oo</code> is <code>oo</code> no matter how you
        look, and <code>o</code> is the same no matter how you
        rotate it.</p>
        <p>All the useful notions of symmetry are exploited in
        Molecular Biology (by Life Itself). It does not “aware”
        that symmetrical molecular arrangements has certain
        properties (which other arrangements lack) but it “uses”
        these “actual facts” in its building blocks.</p>
        <p>Good parts of Math and Philosophy concerned itself with
        “What Is”. So should good programmers do.</p>
        <p>There are philosophical findings that just a handful of
        notions, forms (shapes) and operators (combinators) are
        enough for everything.</p>
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li><i>Partitions</i> of a <i>Set</i> and actual
          <i>cell-membranes</i></li>
          <li><i>Logical connectives</i> (operators)</li>
          <li><i>Lambda Calculus</i></li>
          <li><i>Curry Howard</i> correspondence</li>
          <li><i>Sum and Product types</i> and pattern matching on
          <i>Sum types</i></li>
          <li><i>Lists and Tables</i> as universal data
          structures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If one <i>restricts</i> oneself with just these he still
        will be able to define and express everything, but in
        <i>just the right way</i> (in Buddha’s terminology).</p>
        <p>So, when we program we should think about our structures
        as if they are “universal” and “fundamental”. Abstract
        Lists (and the linked-list “natural” implementation) are
        definitely both universal and fundamental, as has been
        noticed by the great minds in the past.</p>
        <p>Avoid languages without <i>sum-types</i> and <i>pattern
        matching</i> on them. People who made and use these
        languages are ignorant.</p>
        <p>Reduce (collapse) every notion to the universal and
        fundamental ones, so you always will be grounded in <i>What
        Is Real</i>. This is how really smart people, like Donald
        Knuth or Joe Armstrong, design very large and robust
        systems, like TeX or Erlang - they know what if fundamental
        in the first place.</p>
