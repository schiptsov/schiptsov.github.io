Just like in that <i>Rocky</i> movie a good trainer could make a big difference.
</p>

<p>
The first major shortcut to championship is to really know the basic discrete
mathematics, which other people might call &ldquo;core math&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics allow one to solve these <i>Leetcode</i> or <i>Advent to Code</i> problems
<i>easily</i>, because almost everything is based on standard mathematical concepts.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics is an illuminating candle when one tries to master &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;
type-system of modern languages such as <code>Scala</code> or <code>Rust</code>.
</p>

<p>
The most important skill in programming is the ability to see through (a veil
of) bullshit, to <i>zoom trough</i> the levels of abstraction and recognize the
abstraction barriers. Familiarity with some mathematics is how one &ldquo;sees things
as they are&rdquo; and prunes and discards socially constructed memes and bullshit.
</p>

<p>
The main principle is of <i>abstraction</i>, and this is when modern advanced
mathematics really shine. Mathematicians create precisely defined abstractions without
considering its representation or even existence and then study their
<i>properties</i> and <i>relations</i> to other abstractions.
</p>

<p>
It is our burden as programmers to deal with actual <i>representations</i> and
<i>implementations</i>, instead of merely <i>hand-waving</i>. We are the <i>next level up</i>.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, those who know math will naturally embrace the Functional
programming paradigm and even non-strict languages. At least <code>Scala 3</code> or <code>Ocaml</code>.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, there are some universal notions all programming language share with
symbolic calculations or Arithmetic and Algebra.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lambdas (or functions)</li>
<li>Bindings (or naming)</li>
<li>Application (of functions)</li>
<li>Parameterization (and Currying)</li>
<li>Precedence</li>
<li>Nesting (most fundamental)</li>
<li>Scopes</li>
<li>ADTs (exactly as Sets defined in math)</li>
<li>Interfaces (<i>typing</i>)</li>
<li>Algebraic Types (sums and products)</li>
<li>Type-classes (<i>a-la</i> algebraic <i>systems</i>)</li>
<li>Traits (<i>composable</i> sets of interfaces)</li>
<li>Modules (nested structure of the code)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the old glorious times they used to teach fundamental principles and concepts
at MIT, instead of particulars of crappy imperative OO languages, but all this is
long gone. Oldfags like me are the last ones who has been enlightened by the old-school
MIT courses.
</p>

<p>
So, I can be your <i>trainer</i> who will teach you what is important, and will show
some good books to read afterwards. Yes, you need basic mathematics, otherwise
the reading will be a slow torture, instead of just <i>nodding and smiling softly</i>.
I could teach that math too.
</p>

<p>
When one knows the underlying principles one can <i>easily</i> read a hundred pages per
day of any textbook (except C++ or Java, of course, because these are
fundamentally fucked up by brain-dead &ldquo;designers&rdquo; of the cursed <i>Algol</i> lineage).
</p>

<p>
The old-time MIT professors even promised you that - their students will be able
to pickup any decent programming language in a couple of weeks. They really will.
