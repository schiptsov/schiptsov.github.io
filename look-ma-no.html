There is an important result in that <code>ChatGPT</code> system, how exactly it is able not
to overfit and not to become just verbatim memorizing machine. It is some random
noise parameter, or what they call <i>temperature</i> which influenes what the system
selects.
</p>

<p>
It is exactly this <i>temperature</i>, Brownian Motion, &ldquo;collisions of molecules&rdquo; or
<i>fluctuations within the bounds of a current social context</i> is what produces what
we call intelligence. No more, no less.
</p>

<p>
For humans this <i>temperature</i> corresponds to <i>emotions</i> and <i>the social Brownian
Motion</i>, which is usually causes and these emotional swings. This, in turn,
explains a huge literature on naive, generalization-based psychology.
</p>

<p>
Let me explain with a few analogies.
</p>

<p>
What one observes in outside world (in the shared environment) is almost always
<i>results</i>, not the processes which lead to or produce these results. And, of
course, the process is fundamentally different in any aspect from its result.
They are not even on the same level of absraction.
</p>

<p>
We are conditioned by what we call <i>language-based culture</i> (we think in terms of
a language) and thus we are conditioned on <i>stories</i>, <i>movies</i>, <i>memes</i>,and novadays
Instagram photos and short <i>videos</i>.
</p>

<p>
All this media content is very far away from actual reality. It is not even some
kind of generalization or  summary, which is the essence behind some story from
a religious book. It is just a shiny, colorful, emotionally charged bullshit.
</p>

<p>
People <i>pretend</i> to be clever, successful and smart, where in actual reality the
processes are fundamentally different from what has been captured in a
Instagram post.
</p>

<p>
Let me repeat - <i>There is no such things as pure intelligence</i> which is different
from producing intermediate results by &ldquo;throwing anything at the wall and see
what sticks&rdquo; and gradually building upon the results already embedded in the
&ldquo;storage&rdquo; of shared language-based culture.
</p>

<p>
Just as the actual market is fundamentally different from the charts that
we observe, the process of knowledge expansion is very different from the memes
we have create about it.
</p>

<p>
The operational definition of <i>intelligence</i> is  /to continuously update and
maintain a grossly over-simplified inner representation of the shared
environment, and consistently using this inner representation for decision making (instead of
the world itself).
</p>

<p>
This is exactly what every single evolved high-level living form do (humans
differ in having a language and based on it shared culture - another environment
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>which stores the knowledge and socially constructed bullshit).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Instead of using just the shared environment (which we refer to as reality),
humans <i>superimpose</i> on it their own language-based environment of &ldquo;culture and
abstract knowledge&rdquo; and all the recent fuckups on the planet are result of this
superimposition of socially constructed bullshit, instead of seeing things as
they are.
</p>

<p>
So, just a pseudo-random exploration within the current social context. Succession
of mass hysterias, as french guys put it.
</p>

<p>
This result, by the way, is not merely some speculation. The model and the
actual implementation of <code>ChatGPT</code>  accidentally <i>captured</i> the fundamental
principle (it cannot even be built <i>against it</i>, nothng can). <i>The principle</i> was
there all the time.
</p>

<p>
It is time to add one more to the famous Trinity of early Buddhism maxims:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>No intelligence</i>. Just <i>emotional temperature</i> of the social Brownian Motion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Just like <i>not Atman</i> and  <i>no divinity</i>. Just biology.
</p>

<p>
What about so called human geniuses? Einstein? Well, they just fluctuate in the
right direction and their results turned out to stuck on the wall. Everything
has been built upon the previous results, stored in and transmitted by the share
culture (mathematics itself, the current meme-equations, etc).
</p>

<p>
There is no such thing as <i>Divine Intelligence</i>, aside from having and using some
form of inner representation of the shared environment. This, in turn, converges
back to the Buddha&rsquo;s maxim - to see things as they are is to have no mismatch of
your inner representation with <i>What Is</i>, so your <i>inner partially solved Jigsaw Puzzle</i>
has no abstract bullshit pieces which shadow (or veil off) the real ones.
