    <p>The fundamental principle behind <i>deep learning</i>
    (supervised and reinforcement) is that the “right” connections
    are getting “reinforced” while redundant or “wrong” ones are
    getting pruned.</p>
    <p>The neuroscience meme “wire together - fire together” has
    the same underlying principle.</p>
    <p>NNs weights starts at random, while nature uses evolved
    structure, just like a “template”. A language area does not
    start as a random mesh of neurons, it is pre-arranged by
    evolution, just like any other specialized brain area.</p>
    <p>Deep learning mimics an evolved way of simple
    <i>pattern-recognition</i> in a stable environments (where
    these patterns are recurrent and stable).</p>
    <p>This view of <i>deep learning</i> is <i>less wrong</i>,
    closer to actual reality. Any references to “intelligence” are
    just bullshit. Pattern recognition is an important first step,
    but intelligence is far from it.</p>
    <p>An “animal” intelligence requires awareness, consciousness
    capable of introspection (of its emotional states). Higher
    (human) intelligence require self-consciousness and
    language-based abstract thoughts.</p>
    <p>Again, deep learning in <i>unstable environments</i> is
    modern day’s alchemy and tantra.</p>
    <p>On my old now defunct cite I had a definitive example of how
    it works.</p>
    <p>Butterflies have evolved eye-mimicking spots on their wings
    without being aware of it, of course, <i>because in the stable
    shared environment</i> creatures do have eyes.</p>
    <p>This is not just being selected by evolution, it “works”
    because other creatures recognize these patterns as eyes and
    stay away. Notice that this is noting but
    <i>pattern-recognition</i> at work.</p>
