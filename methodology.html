    </header>
    <p>All the research on high-level programming methodologies
    could be summarized in jut a couple of sentences</p>
    <p><code>Write declarative, mostly functional specialized DSLs,
    package them as libraries of higher-order functions and design
    layers of these DLSs</code>. And that is, literally, it.</p>
    <p>Ideally, one strives to have almost exactly <i>declarative
    mathematical notation at the use side</i>, like the list
    comprehensions of Haskell:</p>
    <div class="org-src-container">
      <pre class="src src-haskell"><span style=
      "color: #88C0D0;">map</span> f xs <span style=
      "color: #D8DEE9;">=</span> <span style=
      "color: #81A1C1;">[</span>f x <span style=
      "color: #D8DEE9;">|</span> x <span style=
      "color: #D8DEE9;">&lt;-</span> xs<span style=
      "color: #81A1C1;">]</span>
<span style="color: #6f7787;">-- </span><span style=
"color: #6f7787;">or</span>
<span style="color: #88C0D0;">filter</span> p xs <span style=
"color: #D8DEE9;">=</span> <span style=
"color: #81A1C1;">[</span>x <span style=
"color: #D8DEE9;">|</span> x <span style=
"color: #D8DEE9;">&lt;-</span>xs, p x<span style=
"color: #81A1C1;">]</span>
</pre>

    <p>The Hutton’s dialect of Haskell has <i>monad
    comprehensions</i> too. The infamous <i>do-notation</i> is
    another example of a <i>declarative DSL</i> which hides
    ugliness of implementation details.</p>
    <p>The most successful applications, such as TeX or Rails are
    sets of specialized DSLs.</p>
    <p>The only relevant recent development worth mentioning is
    so-called DDD - Domain Driven Design, which is a high-level
    framework of organizing domain knowledge and extracting
    knowledge from the <i>slang</i> of professionals in the
    field.</p>
    <p>The main point is that the <i>evolved</i> vocabulary and
    standard idioms should be <i>incorporated into</i> and
    <i>directly expressed</i> in code in code. There should not be
    any translation of terms (nouns and verbs) and, ideally, no
    introduction of unnecessary, redundant abstractions, which is
    the root of all evil.</p>
    <p>And that is really it.</p>
    <p>One <i>models</i> actual domain knowledge with math (sets,
    relations and logic), then expresses it as a set of <i>core
    types</i> and implements a <i>declarative DSL</i> around these
    <i>core types</i>.</p>
    <p>This is how a single person (Knuth) or a small team (Rails)
    could bootstrap a really sophisticated project using very
    limited resources (both time and manpower). Getting the
    principles right is the key.</p>
    <p>Notice, how successful <code>Rails</code>, while being
    implemented in a crappy language, and how <code>TeX</code> is
    manageable and virtually bug-free, being a huge collection of
    specialized packages. This is where a <i>proper theory</i>
    works.</p>
    <p>Imagine using better <a href="tools.html">tools</a> for the
    job. It is a well-known, experimentally established fact that a
    solution in Haskell could be a <i>factor of 10</i> less lines
    of code (due to <i>sum-types</i> and <i>pattern-matching on
    them</i>).</p>
    <p>So, FP (Milner, Wadler, Cardelli), modularity (ADTs of
    Lisov) and also the right tools together could guarantee, that
    one <i>at least would not fail miserably</i> and that even a
    partial solution would be <i>reusable</i> and worth time and
    effort spent.</p>

      <h2 id="org5aa3046">C++</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5aa3046">
        <p>While Java is <i>the</i> monument to human stupidity,
        C++ is a tribute to brain-dead over-“engineering” (imagine
        designing a language without putting composition at its
        core and ignoring everything that Lisp, ML and Smalltalk
        communities have researched).</p>
        <p>In C++ one is always very explicit and very verbose
        about every particular implementation detail. Not just
        verbose, but <i>cryptic</i>, which, of course, helps with
        employment - memorizing lots of details and particulars is
        what most people consider as knowledge.</p>
        <p>This habit of being over-verbose about particulars leads
        to creation of unnecessary, redundant and particularly ugly
        abstractions, which quickly become standardized and set in
        stone.</p>
        <p>Modern C++ is such a <i>cathedral</i> of solidified
        crap. Compared to PHP or <code>node_modules</code>,
        however, it is a <i>cathedral</i> indeed. Just don’t look
        too closely of what exactly it is made off.</p>

      <h2 id="org18a64aa">Old timers</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org18a64aa">
        <p>Programmers from the golden era (80s and early 90s)
        which culminated with Haskell 98 report and now in a steady
        decline, used to have a solid background in mathematics, so
        the interfaces they have designed were based on well-known
        <i>mathematical structures</i> with mathematical rigor and
        attention to details. They understood the importance of
        <i>minimal</i> interfaces and <i>uniformity</i>, everything
        that mathematicians of the past realized studying actual
        and <i>generalized patterns</i> of reality (which is what a
        proper math is about).</p>
        <p>No one writes like this anymore, and this is the real
        cause of suffering. The last old-timer language has been
        David Moon’s POPL, or we could consider Scala 3 as the last
        worth of the ML family.</p>
